  "body": "### Description\n\nHello!\r\n\r\nReading the documentation here https://quarkus.io/guides/rest-data-panache there already appears to be a decent amount of customization, but I find myself in a situation where I think my needs exceeds the ability of rest-data to play nicely with my code.\r\n\r\nIf I have a class like `Person`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Person {\r\n    String name;\r\n    List<Friend> friends;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAssuming the `Friend` class is quite big and someone has a lot of friends, I would like to be able to specify an endpoint customization where, instead of the full person, I just get the name using a projection class while maintaining all the abilities of the rest-data resource like autogenerated paging, filtering, etc.\r\n\r\nI've searched everywhere and the only way to do this currently (unless I'm missing something) is to either write a whole bunch of custom methods, or write my own rest endpoint just for this projection, but that would be pretty time consuming and bug prone.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nYou already have the `@ProjectionFor` annotation. Maybe you could scan for it when generating the code, and make the rest endpoints using the class name. So if `Person` has `PersonProjection`, then the endpoints would be:\r\n\r\n/root/person\r\n/root/person-projection",
