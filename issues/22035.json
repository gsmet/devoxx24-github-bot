  "body": "This came from #21997 and #23488.\r\n\r\n#21997 moves the `maven-failsafe-plugin` configuration out of the `native` profile and into the main profile.\r\n\r\n#23488 changes the way codestarts generate sample code - specifically removing `@NativeImageTest` in favor of `@QuarkusIntegrationTest`.\r\n\r\nWhen generating a Gradle project, the project contains a `native-test` source set. This name no longer aligns with the notion of integration test.\r\n\r\nThis issue is for the creation of a new source set representing integration tests (call it `int-test`, `intTest`, `integration-test`, or whatever else you'd like to call it).\r\n\r\nThis would all have to be backwards compatible of course, for a period of time. Projects already out there that have the `native-test` source set should still work, and any customizations to it should \"flow\" into this new source set.\r\n\r\nIt would have a rippling effect as well, since the Gradle plugin also has the `testNative` task, along with the `nativeTestImplementation` and `nativeTestRuntimeOnly` configurations.\r\n\r\nTo be consistent we'd have to introduce a new source set (something like `int-test`). We'd have to figure out a proper hierarchy (is the new source set the parent or child of the existing `native-test` source set?) and then apply configuration to it.\r\n\r\nThe new source set would most likely have to become the child of the existing one, so that any tweaks any current users have made will automagically \"flow\" into this new source set.\r\n\r\nThen we'd have to update the documentation. And do we also introduce a new task `testIntegration` to be consistent? Now we have the same backwards compatibility problem there as well. We'd need to maintain backwards compatibility for a period of time.\r\n\r\nThe direction that is decided as part of #21997 (whether to always run integration test or have the user opt-into it - [this comment](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/21997#issuecomment-1035001857)) may dictate this behavior (i.e. keep it consistent). Personally I would think that it _should_ all be tied back into the `build` task, so running `./gradlew build` would run the unit tests, build the application (native, container image, jar, etc), and then execute the integration tests against whatever is built.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @edeandrea in https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/21997#issuecomment-988022858_",
