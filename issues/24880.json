  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nThis follows the discussion in https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-platform/pull/521\r\n\r\nQuarkus does some conscious choices when it comes to preferring some artifacts and banning the alternatives. \r\n\r\nJakarta spec jars are the most prominent example: Generally the jakarta spec artifacts are preferred and the obsolete alternatives coming from JBoss, Glassfish, javax and Geronimo are be banned. There are exceptions to this general rule (Quarkus in some cases prefers jboss or glassfish artifacts) and typically not all existing alternatives are banned (not sure why).\r\n\r\nIt is similar with logging backends: some third party artifacts are banned in favor of some JBoss logging artifacts.\r\n\r\nIt is generally beneficial for Quarkus Platform participants to stick with the policies adopted in Quarkus Core. On one hand this increases the chances to get working selection of artifacts in end user applications and on the other hand it may save time and cognitive load with deciding which alternative to choose.\r\n\r\nFrom the platform participant PoV, it is easy to overtake the bans from Quarkus poms, but it is less easy and obvious to implement replacements towards the preferred alternatives. \r\n\r\nI wonder whether Quarkus Core maintainers, esp. @gsmet would be ready to maintain this kind of rules in structured form, so that platform participant projects and Quarkus Platform itself can observe/enforce them automatically. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\nI do not have any specific format or tool in mind. Enforcer plugin forks well for enforcing bans, but I am not aware that it would also allow enforcing replacements. I'd be thankful for any suggestions.\r\n",
