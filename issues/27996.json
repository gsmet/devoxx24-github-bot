  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nI have run into the problem (I've seen this in dev-mode, but don't know if it is specific to that), that config properties which are provided by test profiles (using `QuarkusTestProfile#getConfigOverrides()`) can bleed into later tests which don't use that profile.\r\n\r\nI did some debugging and AFAICT the problem is in `io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusTestExtension#doJavaStart()`. In the called `createAugmentor()` method the `RestorableSystemProperties.setProperties()` method is called which sets the profile's config overrides as system properties and also returns a shutdown handler to restore the previous values. But `doJavaStart()` doesn't register these shutdown handlers until the very end and when executing the tests it is possible that these throw an exception (in my case I got an `ExceptionInInitializerError` which as its cause had an `RuntimeException` with the message `Failed to start quarkus`. As a consequence the shutdown handlers never get registered and the profile's config properties remain available as system properties.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIf profile config property overrides get set as system properties it must be ensured that these get properly reset / cleared, even if the test failed or throws exceptions.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\nIf requested I could look into provide a reproducer, but this may take some time.\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n_No response_\n\n### GraalVM version (if different from Java)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n2.12.2.Final\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",
