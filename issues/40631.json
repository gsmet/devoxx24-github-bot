  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nI have a pod that is triggering the execution of the knative function I created using FunQ and then it waits until it receives an event. This event is sent by the knative function.\r\n\r\nThe pod is stateful, so if it gets deleted once it's running again it will resume waiting for the event.\r\n\r\nBut when the pod is restarted, it never receives any event from the knative function despite the fact that the function sent it, and the pod was ready to receive it.\r\nWhen I send the event manually using `curl`, the pod is receiving the event and continuing its execution.\r\n\r\nIf I do not delete the pod, everything works fine, the issue only appears when the pod is deleted/restarted.\r\n\r\nI failed to gather any log related to the firing of the event from the knative function.\r\n\r\nSame for the `knative-eventing` resources (ingress,...) I see nothing in the logs so I am even wondering if the cloudevent is sent to the broker or to the pod directly...\r\n\r\nI am using an in-memory broker.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe restarted pod should receive the event from the broker.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nNo event seems to be received by the in-memory broker when the origin pod is restarted.\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n_No response_\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",
