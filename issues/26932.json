  "body": "Please, could it be possible to provide better support for `ResourceBundle`?\r\n\r\nWe'd like having the resources for `ResourceBundle` in external files, so that we could patch them or extend them without rebuilding the whole application, but we struggle with that. It seems that `ResourceBundle` works well if its resources are embedded in the application, but we could not make it work with external resources. No guide seems to give any useful hints either. We have concerns about native images as well â€“ maybe it needs more support from the framework.",
