  "body": "I am playing around with Quarkus REST support with both RESTeasy reactive API and Reactive Routes API.\r\nI am using Postman as HTTP client for some tests.\r\nI noticed that the Reactive Routes based implementation is \"not able\" to handle HTTP \"keep-alive\".\r\nI mean ... if the HTTP client has the keep-alive, the first HTTP request works fine and the client gets back the response. Any other subsequent request hangs and the Quarkus application doesn't reply. \r\nThis doesn't happen with the RESTeasy reactive implementation which works fine.\r\nOf course, if I disable the \"keep-alive\", the Reactive Routes application works fine replying any requests.\r\nUsing Wireshark I see the right HTTP traffic (including the keep-alive packets) but as I said with Reactive Routes, no reply from the application after the first request.\r\nIs there anything I am missing (maybe configuration?).\r\n\r\nRESTeasy: https://gist.github.com/ppatierno/de047fb8a06c425d29fc84487040f06b\r\nReactive Routes: declarative (https://gist.github.com/ppatierno/5eb582b8237828c731c34858719fbaa2) and using the router (https://gist.github.com/ppatierno/2357faa8bcd8148c71e8be48101d5369)\r\n",
