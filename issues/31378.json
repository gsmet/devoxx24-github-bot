  "body": "I just started one of my applications and I ended up with the following warning at startup:\r\n```\r\n2023-02-23 18:17:47,306 WARN  [io.qua.arc.dep.BeanArchiveProcessor] (build-24) Detected bean archive with bean discovery mode of 'all', this is not portable in CDI Lite and is treated as 'annotated' in Quarkus! Path to beans.xml: /META-INF/beans.xml\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first step in improving the situation is to improve the warn message to include the artifact as with the current message, it's impossible to know which dependency is problematic (I don't have a `beans.xml` in my app, this is coming from a dependency).\r\nI already have a patch for it and will open a PR.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand the rationale of it, we need to make sure that all our extensions are free of this or our users will all start seeing these warnings.\r\n\r\nFor instance, SmallRye GraphQL is problematic: https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-graphql/blob/main/client/implementation/src/main/resources/META-INF/beans.xml .\r\n\r\nAnd there might be others.\r\n\r\nSo we would need to go through the full CI log and check the occurrences of this message once the improved error message is merged.",
