  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this extension is to integrate Pusher beams server java library to the Quarkus ecosystem and provide native support for it.\r\n\r\nPusher beams is a notification solution (saas) to send notifications to Android, iOS, Web clients (single/grouped notification, topic based notification, authenticated clients notifications)\r\n\r\n**What this extension will offer**\r\n\r\n- CDI injection of Pusher beams component\r\n- Pusher beams configuration\r\n- Class registration & co\r\n- Support classes to execute Pusher operations\r\n- Support component to handle retry system (automatic handling of 429 HTTP error since Pusher API is rate limited)\r\n\r\n**Who this extension is for**\r\nPeople interested in this extension will be people using Pusher beams product and interested in sending notifications from their Java / Quarkus backend, managing Pusher beams authenticated users, etc.\r\n\r\nInterested in this extension, please +1 via the emoji/reaction feature of GitHub (top right).\r\n\r\n### Configuration suggestion\r\n\r\n```\r\n# default true, to activate/deactivate the extension at build time\r\nquarkus.pusher.beams.enabled=true/false\r\n# minimum configuration required to connect to your pusher beams instance.\r\nquarkus.pusher.beams.instance-id=xxxxxx\r\nquarkus.pusher.beams.secret-key=xxxxxx\r\n# any other optional configuration for this extension. Example: retry system\r\nquarkus.pusher.beams.retry.max=3\r\nquarkus.pusher.beams.retry.delay=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThe extension is not yet developed by i already have integrated it in one of my services written with Quarkus.\r\n\r\nI just want to share it with the community as well as maintain it in a central place and as an extension so that i can re-use it across multiple services.\r\n\r\nThis extension should belongs to the Quarkiverse Hub if accepted - i guess.\r\n\r\nI'm of course interested in leading the development of this extension as i'm using it inside a Quarkus application and i've already proposed and wrote another extension for Datadog open tracer for Quarkiverse a while ago ([here](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-datadog-opentracing))",
