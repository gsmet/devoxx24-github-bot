  "body": "### Description\n\nCurrently when a quarkus extension brings in a CLI plguin, the name of the plugin is configured in the extension metadata.\r\nExtension developer need to align the alias used with the root command name. So, one needs to add the same information in two places.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if there was a way to infer the alias from the root command name.\r\n\r\n## Challenges\r\nHowever, this means that the CLI should download the CLI plugin, find the root command and get the information from there. \r\nAnd this is something that most probably should be repeated on each invocation of `quarkus --help` and `quarkus my-plugin xyz`\r\n\r\nOn top of that we will have to deal with things like maven artifact downloading etc, that's now outsourced to jbang.\r\n\r\nAn alternative could be to produce some short of metadata at the time of building the CLI plugin that would be available to the extension. But I don't have something more concrete than that.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n_No response_",
