  "body": "### Description\n\nIt would be neat if [`@GrpcClient`](https://quarkus.io/guides/grpc-service-consumption) would optionally support binding to service implementation which are registered on an [`InProcessServerBuilder`](https://grpc.github.io/grpc-java/javadoc/io/grpc/inprocess/InProcessServerBuilder.html) by configuration.\r\n\r\nIMHO this could have value not just for tests but also for (early) production runtime situations... like you start sketching out code with gRPC but aren't quite ready / need to actually deploy it as separate microservices just yet, or perhaps for local development never actually want to do that locally. So (\"just for now\", or perhaps \"forever\") you (alternatively, optionally) bundle it all up in one big fat \"macroservice\" ðŸ˜„ ... which perhaps is a Gradle/Maven project which has dependencies on the \"fine grained\" service implementation, which when using that artifact you run in-process.\r\n\r\nWould contributions to support this be welcome?\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n_No response_",
