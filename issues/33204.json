Unfortunately, my server is not receiving the mode or signing variables needed to create the containers when a # is included in the URL. \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI was expecting my server to receive the mode and signing variables regardless of if a # is included in the URL. \n\n### Actual behavior\n\nThe mode and signing variables are not sent to my server and only \"http://localserver/containers/container01\" is received by the server. \n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n_No response_\n\n### GraalVM version (if different from Java)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n_No response_\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\nIf this is a feature that I am unaware of, I would appreciate some input on how to work around this issue so that my server can receive the whole URL including the #.
