  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nGoing through the [security-authorize-web-endpoints-reference](https://quarkus.io/version/main/guides/security-authorize-web-endpoints-reference) guide I found some issues.\r\n\r\n1. There is sentence `For more information, see Path Resolution in Quarkus.` which lead to Quarkus blog post from 2021. Not saying it's bad thing or problem, but blog can contain outdated information (I didn't read it). This blog post mentioning Quarkus 1.12.\r\n2. There is `In the following example, SecurityIdentity is customized to add the same` where link is as this `` `SecurityIdentity` is customized``. It's not wrong but it seems kinda weird to have link with 2 colors. This is also in title of this section [Map SecurityIdentity roles](https://quarkus.io/version/main/guides/security-authorize-web-endpoints-reference#map-security-identity-roles).\r\n3. The [Custom HttpSecurityPolicy](https://quarkus.io/version/main/guides/security-authorize-web-endpoints-reference#custom-httpsecuritypolicy) contains unresolved method `customRequestAuthorization`. It can't be said how this method should look. Similar method I found is in [CustomNamedHttpSecPolicy.java](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/main/extensions/vertx-http/deployment/src/test/java/io/quarkus/vertx/http/security/CustomNamedHttpSecPolicy.java)\r\n4. [Authorization using annotations](https://quarkus.io/version/main/guides/security-authorize-web-endpoints-reference#standard-security-annotations) second snippet of `SubjectExposingResource` class have unused `DenyAll` and `PermitAll` imports.\r\n5. [Permission annotation](https://quarkus.io/version/main/guides/security-authorize-web-endpoints-reference#permission-annotation) \r\n\\- `LibraryService` missing import of `LibraryPermission.Library`.\r\n\\- `LibraryResource` don't have any import as only snippet in docs.\r\n\\- `MediaLibraryPermission` have unused imports.\r\n\\- `LibraryPermission` I understand this is long snippet so I agree to skip some content using `...` but I think that would be better use comment in sense `here override Permission methods and can implement your own`. Just for more guidance for reader.\r\n6. [Permission annotation](https://quarkus.io/version/main/guides/security-authorize-web-endpoints-reference#permission-annotation) maybe it would be nice to add command/test to show how to check if it's work.\r\n7. [Permission annotation](https://quarkus.io/version/main/guides/security-authorize-web-endpoints-reference#permission-annotation)  same part but it's better to be one point. After explaining the first property there is point `#4` which start `You can also specify a custom implementation of the java.security.Permission class`, in next paragraph it start with `You can also create a custom java.security.Permission class` and after we jump after the snippet there is `There must be exactly one constructor of a custom Permission class.` which is also mentioned in point `#4`. These 3 say lots of similar things which I don't say it's wrong but personally I would not use `also` in second occurrence.\r\n8. [Permission annotation](https://quarkus.io/version/main/guides/security-authorize-web-endpoints-reference#permission-annotation) last thing for this section is  when set `CRUDResource` by guide with the property `quarkus.http.auth.policy.role-policy2.permission-class=org.acme.crud.CRUDResource.CustomPermission` the Quarkus not start and throw error NoClassWasFound. I had package name correctly and tested it with Library example and when use `public static class <ClassName> extends Permission` inside of another class it still fail. So maybe this is bug or just not accepted solution.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n_No response_\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",
