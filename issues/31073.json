  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nThe Maven bootstrap resolver ignores Maven extensions that are registered via `.mvn/extensions.xml` in the project root.\r\nWe have a custom extension that modifies artifact repository URLs based on the current Git branch. This works perfectly during build time but when the tests start, Quarkus seems to perform artifact resolution (again) and ignores this extension. This results in wrong artifacts being pulled in which leads to very strange errors (such as not finding a method that must have been present when the code was compiled).\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nMaven extension are used.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nMaven extension are ignored.\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\nDifficult because you need a Maven extension that does something meaningful and breaks the tests if it's not being used. If this is really required I may be able to come up with a dummy extension but it should not be difficult to find out why Maven extensions are completely ignored.\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n17\n\n### GraalVM version (if different from Java)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n2.14.3.Final\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\nMaven 3.8.7\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",
