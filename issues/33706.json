  "body": "### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nWhen I attempted to update https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-workshops/tree/main/quarkus-workshop-super-heroes (a multi-module project), my first attempt died with a big stack trace. The meat was this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n [ERROR] The project does not import any Quarkus platform BOM\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a side effect of the way the quarkus workshop is structured. The failure happened because I was in the root of a multi-module project, but I would have struggled to work that out from the stack traces, or even the error message. Apparently we do work for multi-module, but only if the root project imports a quarkus platform pom.\r\n\r\nThere are two levels of fix: \r\n\r\n- Full fix. Work for multi-module projects without the requirement to import the platform pom.\r\n- Usability fix (as suggested by @maxandersen): \"makes sense we at least make the error more informative. i.e. we actually should be able to tell if the project is multimodule and state they could go to the sub project and run it.\" ... and ideally also prevent the stack trace so the message is more prominent.\r\n",
