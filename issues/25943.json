  "body": "### Description\r\nAdjust Quarkus to upcoming Native Image API changes. An initial discussion happened during the [Native Image Committer Community Meeting on 2nd of June](https://github.com/oracle/graal/discussions/4616).\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nThe following required changes were noted during the discussion:\r\n\r\n- [x] Switch from `AutomaticFeature` to `Feature` and then pass in features in use via `--feature`.\r\n- [ ] `AlwaysInline` won't be exposed in the API so we should stop using it. `io/quarkus/runtime/graal/ConfigurationSubstitutions` and `io/quarkus/jdbc/h2/runtime/graal/RemoteOnly` are the only remaining users.\r\n- ~[ ] `-H:` options are not public API. During the meeting @christianwimmer said some of those should become API (e.g. `--blah` option) and others might no longer be used (e.g. We should stop disabling `ParseOnce` with 22.2 because memory footprint there has been improved, see https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/25944 for more details). He said he'd investigate Quarkus' use of those are create an issue with recommendations.~ Work split into https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/27784\r\n\r\nFYI @zakkak @jerboaa @n1hility @Sanne @geoand",
