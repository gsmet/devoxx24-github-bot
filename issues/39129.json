  "body": "### Description\n\nThere is currently no way to change the JDK used by quarkus-maven-plugin, which is an annoyance for developers that have to switch between projects using different JDK versions.\r\nUsually we would do one of these two things to specify the path to the JDK the project should use:\r\n- change the `<executable>` in maven-compiler-plugin's `<configuration>` to point to something like `${JAVA_17_HOME}/bin/javac`\r\n- use a Maven toolchain\r\n\r\nHowever, none of these approaches work for Quarkus projects, since they don't have any effect on quarkus-maven-plugin. We now have to resort to manually changing the JAVA_HOME environment variable before executing with Maven, or to automatically changing it inside the Maven wrapper script. The latter approach is not ideal because JAVA_HOME stays changed even after the Maven command has finished, and it doesn't work if the developer uses mvn instead of mvnw.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we could set a custom path to the javac executable used by quarkus-maven-plugin. Support for toolchains would also be awesome, but I think that's already tracked in this issue: https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/12943\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nAdd an `<executable>` property to quarkus-maven-plugin's `<configuration>` section",
