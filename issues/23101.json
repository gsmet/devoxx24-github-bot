  "body": "### Description\n\nThere seems to be some significant use cases where the registry that a built container image will be pushed to, and the registry that it would be deployed from might be different. In particular, if you have multi-region clusters, it is common to have mirrors of your container registry in each region. This is important both to reduce data transfer costs and deployment times. A strategy I attempted with my deployment in Kubernetes is to use the kubernetes override file in `src/main/kubernetes/kubernetes.yml` to insert the deployment (mirrored) registry at `spec.template.spec.containers[0].image` but the way that the override file is merged into the quarkus-generated kubernetes configuration causes it to be ignored.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nA simple but crude implementation to work-around this would be to alter the way that the final deployment descriptor (`kubernetes.yml` in the case of kubernetes) is merged with overrides to allow the deployment registry to be specified. This would have the slight downside that the image name and the image version would have to be kept in sync in multiple places and could lead to a situation where if one wasn't careful, you could end up pushing one image to the registry, and deploying a different one.\r\nA more direct but complicated implementation would be to add a new configurable value or set of values to the `quarkus.container-image` configuration group that would allow separate image push and image deployment values.",
