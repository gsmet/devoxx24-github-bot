  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nThe [conditional extension documentation](https://quarkus.io/guides/conditional-extension-dependencies) makes reference to \"conditional dependencies\" and even has a header for it, yet the term \"dependency condition\" is not properly defined, even though it is used in the Maven pom.xml and in the Gradle DSL.\r\n\r\nNormally I don't make a big deal over strange naming, but in this case failing to set these properties results in a frustratingly-silent failure of sorts, in which case the extension simply won't be included in the dependency graph.\r\n\r\nAt the very least the \"dependency condition\" terminology should be called out explicitly by name and given its own description. I think it would also benefit from a rename as well, such as \"deployedWhenAllPresent\" or something like that. My example is not very good but hopefully it demonstrates my intent.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n_No response_\n\n### GraalVM version (if different from Java)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n2.8.3.Final\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\nSince the bug concerns documentation, I didn't fill the entire form out. Let me know if you want me to rewrite the issue with more information.",
