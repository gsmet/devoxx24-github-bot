  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\n- We are running Keycloak using Quarkus on MS Azure with MS Azure SQL as database\r\n- We are regularly experiencing connection problems to the Azure DB where some connections drop and new connections cannot be established but existing connections still work\r\n- With Keycloak based on Wildly/IronJacamar as pooling implementation, there were request processing errors - with Quarkus/Agroal-based Keycloak 20 requests cannot be processed anymore\r\n- note this is a copy of https://issues.redhat.com/browse/AG-201\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nGIVEN there are database connection problems\r\nAND the current number of connections is below MIN_SIZE\r\nAND there are still valid connections in the pool\r\nAND new connections cannot be created\r\nWHEN a connection is requested from the pool\r\nTHEN then an existing connection from the pool is returned and the request succeeds\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nGIVEN there are database connection problems\r\nAND the current number of connections is below MIN_SIZE\r\nAND there are still valid connections in the pool\r\nAND new connections cannot be created\r\nWHEN a connection is requested from the pool\r\nTHEN no connection can be obtained and the request fails\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\nWe reproduced the behaviour by changing the db password on a running application so the pool cannot create new connections and killing existing db sessions to bring the number of connections below MIN_SIZE.\r\n\r\nHowever, the problem can be seen directly in the code: https://github.com/agroal/agroal/blob/4c4da6419652f772542e648581d0d8939c411b5e/agroal-pool/src/main/java/io/agroal/pool/ConnectionPool.java#L270-L323\r\n-  if a new connection cannot be established, a TimeoutException is thrown and the code to take a connection from the pool is never reached\r\n- while it might be a good idea to trigger filling up the pool to MIN_SIZE, the current request should not incur the delay and probably the failure of obtaining a new connection but rather prefer using an existing connection - IMHO filling up should happen only concurrently \n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n_No response_\n\n### GraalVM version (if different from Java)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n_No response_\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",
