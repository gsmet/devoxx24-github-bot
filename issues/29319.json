  "body": "Currently we are using Quarkus/quartz cluster mode with `store-type: jdbc_tx`, in a situations where the scheduler has very large numbers of triggers that need to be fired at or near the same time.\r\n\r\nPer quartz official documentation http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/configuration/ConfigMain.html#configuration-reference the performance expected to improve by setting:\r\n\r\n`org.quartz.scheduler.batchTriggerAcquisitionFireAheadTimeWindow `(the larger the number, the more efficient firing is (in situations where there are very many triggers needing to be fired all at once)\r\n\r\n`org.quartz.scheduler.batchTriggerAcquisitionMaxCount` (the larger the number, the more likely batch acquisition of triggers to fire will be able to select and fire more than 1 trigger at a time)\r\n\r\n`org.quartz.jobStore.acquireTriggersWithinLock` (to avoid data corruption).\r\n\r\nBut Quarkus/quartz does not expose these properties as configurable. Would it be possible to expose the underlying default quartz configuration so that we can leverage the quartz batch mode?\r\n\r\nQuartz provides these configurations: http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/configuration/ConfigMain.html\r\nAnd Quarkus/Quartz provides these: https://quarkus.io/guides/quartz#quartz-configuration-reference\r\n\r\n@cescoffier\r\n",
