  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nI intend to eventually make ArC fully compliant with the CDI Lite part of CDI 4.0. This entails:\r\n\r\n- implementing Build Compatible Extensions in ArC\r\n- implementing an Arquillian adapter for ArC\r\n- adding a CDI TCK runner module to ArC\r\n- most likely adding a special mode (off by default) that enables strict spec compliance\r\n- fixing the issues found by the TCK\r\n\r\nThis issue is a tracker for all that. Work will start on this when Quarkus mainline switches to Jakarta EE 10 dependencies and ArC specifically switches to CDI 4.0.\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\nI actually have quite a lot of that already implemented on a non-public branch (that I've been rebasing for more than 2 years actually). Specifically:\r\n\r\n- Arquillian adapter is implemented (could be submitted now, but would cause too much churn), together with a simple CDI Lite TCK runner module\r\n- Build Compatible Extensions are implemented and pass all the relevant CDI TCK tests\r\n\r\nWhat I didn't focus on yet is passing the full CDI Lite TCK. As is, ArC passes roughly 1/2 of the CDI Lite TCK, so there's quite some work to do. I expect that some tests in the CDI Lite TCK are always going to fail due to some improvements we made in ArC and are not willing to give up -- for that reason, I expect we'll have to add a switch for enabling strict spec compliance at the cost of foregoing the improvements. That switch will be off by default, but we'll turn it on to pass the TCK. Users will also be able to turn it on if they so desire.\r\n\r\n### List of related PRs\r\n\r\n- #30447\r\n- #30452\r\n- #30509\r\n- #30544\r\n- #30666\r\n- #30917\r\n- #30924\r\n- #30950\r\n- #31062\r\n- #31085\r\n- #31248\r\n- #31348\r\n- #31444\r\n- #31589\r\n- #31702\r\n- #31814\r\n- #32407\r\n- #32730\r\n- #32885\r\n- #32945\r\n- #32984\r\n- #33051\r\n- #33447\r\n- #33523\r\n- #33638\r\n- #33719",
