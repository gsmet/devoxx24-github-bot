  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nThis issue was already described at https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/discussions/23699. We've now been able to pinpoint the issue in more detail.\r\n\r\nThere's a race condition at https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/main/extensions/azure-functions-http/runtime/src/main/java/io/quarkus/azure/functions/resteasy/runtime/BaseFunction.java#L46. With two concurrent requests, we've been able to identity at least three paths into the application:\r\n\r\n* For both requests, `Application.currentApplication() == null`, is true. Both requests try to initialize Quarkus. One succeeds (`started` is set to true), the other fails with an \"io.netty.channel.ChannelException: address already in use\" error (`bootstrapError` is set to true). The latter causes every subsequent request to fail, because `bootstrapError` will forever be true.\r\n* For the first request, `Application.currentApplication() == null`, is true. It correctly starts Quarkus. The `app.start` from `BaseFunction` starts with setting the `currentApplication`, see https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/main/core/runtime/src/main/java/io/quarkus/runtime/Application.java#L72. For the second request, `Application.currentApplication() == null`, is now false. However, the dispatch is done even when Quarkus hasn't been started completely yet. The result is \"No CDI Container available\" or one of many possible NullPointerExceptions.\r\n* For the first request, `Application.currentApplication() == null`, is true, and Quarkus is started completely. The second request comes in after that, `Application.currentApplication() == null`, is false. and the dispatch succeeds.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nEven with multiple concurrent requests, Quarkus needs to be started exactly once, and no requests should fail because either Quarkus is started more than once or because requests are dispatched when Quarkus is still starting up.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nSee the bug description.\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\nSee https://github.com/rob-spoor/quarkus-azure-functions-http-race-condition. However, getting all of the possible errors is tricky because of timing constraints.\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\nMicrosoft Windows [Version 10.0.19044.1526]\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\nopenjdk version \"11.0.14.1\" 2022-02-08 OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-11.0.14.1+1 (build 11.0.14.1+1) OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-11.0.14.1+1 (build 11.0.14.1+1, mixed mode)\n\n### GraalVM version (if different from Java)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n2.7.1\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\nApache Maven 3.8.4 (9b656c72d54e5bacbed989b64718c159fe39b537)\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",
