  "body": "### Description\n\nAs a Quarkus developer I use Quarkus to deploy high throughput services using protocols like HTTP/WS/Kafka/AMQP/MQTT/etc. Currently Quarkus has great support for HTTP/WS/Kafka but not AMQP/MQTT/etc. The reason why, is that to support high throughput I need multi-reactor support (i.e. multiple event-loops/threads per deployment). HTTP/WS already allows me to specify the exact number of event-loops/threads and Kafka also indirectly supports this through specifying the number of partitions.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there's no good way to do this for several of the other protocols currently supported through  \"[SmallRye Reactive Messaging](https://smallrye.io/smallrye-reactive-messaging/smallrye-reactive-messaging/2/connectors/connectors.html)\" or even using Vert.x clients directly again for protocols like AMQP/MQTT/etc.\r\n\r\nThe reason why is Quarkus either allows me to: \r\n1. Deploy non-bean Verticles and specify however many instances I want but have limited dependency injection support (and possible other limitations I haven't discovered)\r\n2. [Deploy Verticles as @ApplicationScoped beans](https://quarkus.io/guides/vertx-reference#deploying-verticles) and get everything I'm expecting but then I cannot deploy more than 1 instance of the Verticle without getting the error \"Can't specify > 1 instances for already created verticle\". \r\n\r\nI've been exploring this issue with Clement Escoffier on StackOverflow which is why I'm confident that I'm not doing something wrong: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69079674/how-to-start-multiple-message-consumers-in-quarkus/69199020\r\n\r\nMy feature request:\r\n\r\n> I request that Quarkus support deploying Verticles as beans with more than one instance per deployment.\r\n\r\nAlternatives I considered:\r\n\r\n- Deploying non-beans with limited injection support - that's what I'm using for now\r\n- Horizontal scaling vs. Verticle scaling - this is not an option for me. I'm using Quarkus because I require a lot of CPU for high throughput and I cannot waste the CPUs given to me. Based on performance testing if only use only 1 connection to a message broker per deployment the performance is much worse than if I have 2 or 4 connections.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n_No response_",
