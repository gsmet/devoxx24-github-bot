  "body": "### Description\n\nWhen using `@Consumes(\"text/xml; charset=utf-8\")` for example, it gets converted to something like`MediaType(\"text\", \"xml\", [\"charset\" -> \"utf-8\"])` and in the request, the header sent is `Content-Type: text/xml;charset=utf-8`.\r\n\r\nFor my use case I explicitly need to have `text/xml; charset=utf-8` (note the space after the semicolon) and I can't find a way to override the header, because the parsing of the `@Consumes` annotation will trim the spaces.\r\n\r\nIf I add the `@ClientHeaderParam` annotation to the RestClient to override the `Content-Type` header, it doesn't seem to have any effect.\r\n\r\nUsing a `ClientRequestFilter`, by overriding the request headers of the received context also seems to have no effect\r\n\r\nFinally, still using a `ClientRequestFilter` I am able to retrieve the media type, however I am not able to change it\r\n\r\nP.S: Would be really useful if it could be available in Quarkus 2 as I wasn't able to migrate to Quarkus 3 yet\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nI think the easiest way to accomplish this is by creating a setter method on the `ClientRequestContext` for the MediaType annotation",
