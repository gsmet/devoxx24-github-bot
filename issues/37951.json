  "body": "### Description\n\nDear Quarkus Team,\r\n\r\n  I am an enthusiastic user of Quarkus and extensively use it in my projects. Currently, I am exploring the integration of Sa-Token into Quarkus to provide authentication and authorization capabilities in my applications.\r\n  \r\n  I have successfully implemented a preliminary integration of Sa-Token with the non-reactive version of Quarkus. However, recognizing the importance of the reactive programming model in Quarkus for modern application development, I am keen to see full support for Sa-Token in this paradigm.\r\n  \r\n  Due to my technical limitations in implementing the reactive version, I have not been able to complete this part. Hence, I would like to propose a feature request for the Quarkus official team to consider integrating Sa-Token as part of the reactive applications support. Such integration would greatly enhance Quarkus's capabilities in handling modern, high-performance applications and provide more authentication and authorization options to the community users.\r\n  \r\n  I believe this integration would not only benefit my personal projects but also add value to the wider Quarkus developer community.\r\n  \r\n  Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of this feature in future versions of Quarkus and am willing to provide any possible assistance and feedback.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nhttps://github.com/dromara/sa-token",
