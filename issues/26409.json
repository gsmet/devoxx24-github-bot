  "body": "### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nWe are running dozens of services in Quarkus.\r\nWe have recently migrated a service from Micronaut to Quarkus, and we have realised that we cannot apply [DNS Load Balancing](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/54311)  using [Quarkus RestClient](https://quarkus.io/guides/rest-client).\r\n\r\nIt appears that Quarkus Rest client uses \"DNS Pinning\", whereas micronaut and grails are not doing it.\r\n\r\nIt happens with both resteasy classic and reactive resteasy.\r\n\r\nWe have tried to solve it:\r\n- with JVM configuration, adding `networkaddress.cache.ttl=0`, but this demonstrated that even if configured to perform DNS queries all the time, services will attempt to use IPs that were used in the past, if they are present in the DNS response.\r\n- moving back to non-native images. It did not work.\r\n\r\nThis effectively means that we cannot use autoscale.\r\n\r\nWe are going to try to use Stork, but that's not a solution, and there are chances that it suffers from the same issue.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nRotation across the DNS IPs when doing requests.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nSame IP (machine) is hit continuously, unless the service is restarted.\r\n\r\n### Output of `java -version`\r\n\r\nJava 17\r\n\r\n### GraalVM version (if different from Java)\r\n\r\nNo need to.\r\n\r\n### Quarkus version or git rev\r\n\r\n2.10.0.Final\r\n\r\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\r\n\r\nGradle.\r\n\r\n",
