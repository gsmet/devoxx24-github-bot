  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nHello, I'm not really sure it's a Quarkus bug, but however...\r\nWe have a Quarkus application running on Docker container with OpenJDK 11 JVM on Kubernetes. Some messages seems to be ignored but JVM and after a lot of days of debugging I cannot still find the problem.\r\nWhat I've noticed, when running tcpdump on docker container, I see that the IP message is received and ACKed by the network layer, but after that there is nothing... JVM doesn't take the message in account and it's not processed at all. I already tried JMX to see if there are any blocked threads, but there are nothing blocked and the message seems to be completely ignored (still cannot understand how it could happen).\r\nThe only thing we notice, that it happens just after receiving a huge message?\r\nMaybe someone have a similar problem? May be some useful configuration to change? \r\nI tried activating all logs, but still no trace about this message...\r\n\r\nIf someone have an idea how to debug it, can you please share?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n_No response_\n\n### GraalVM version (if different from Java)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n_No response_\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",
