  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nIn keycloak users may contribute provider jars via the providers directory. The split package logic however will not consider most of what is included in the lib directory because those depedencies failed to be picked up by this logic https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/09ff3b6de7cd088f26ada351a0743a9e4f97e2e5/core/deployment/src/main/java/io/quarkus/deployment/index/ApplicationArchiveBuildStep.java#L144 - they must lack the expected markers. \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nAll lib directory jars should be checked, similar to how the logic is checking all jars in the providers directory.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nOnly a subset of the lib dependencies are scanned.\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\nAdd the common-lang3 jar into the Keycloak providers folder and start the server, there's no split package warning on start up - even though common-lang3 is a built-in dependency.\r\n\r\nAdd another copy of the common-lang3 jar into the providers folder and start the server, now there's a split package warning.\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n3.8.2\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\nSee https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/26396#issuecomment-1986211246\r\n\r\nI know it might need a separate enhancement, but could it be possible to have an option make re-augmentation fail if there is a split package between the lib and providers directory? By the time the user sees the warning their providers jar is already added to the classloading index, such that if they remove their provider jar then in several circumstances they will see no such file exceptions.",
