  "body": "### Description\n\nThis question came to my mind after reading https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/31831.\r\n\r\nAs part of Kogito, we have 2 parts:\r\n- Kogito Runtimes, aka runtimes and apps artifacts, to use Kogito\r\n- Kogito Cloud, aka images and operator, which are aiming at simplyfying the use of Kogito\r\n\r\nIn Kogito Cloud, we use directly Kogito Runtimes for our apps but when building services, we made the choice to use the Quarkus Platform directly, for Quarkus projects (this is especially the case in Kogito Serverless Workflow which depends only on Quarkus).\r\n\r\nBut this brings sometime out of sync issues between Runtimes and Cloud parts.\r\n\r\nWe merely solved the problem on Kogito by using our own build of Quarkus Platform for our nightlies.\r\nBut the problem remains on our releases as we may want to:\r\n\r\n1. Release our Runtimes\r\n2. Update Platform with our runtimes\r\n3. Need to update Cloud with a platform version which contains the latest runtimes reference\r\n\r\n**So I am raising the question of having automatic Platform release when a new member update its version in the Platform ?**\r\n\r\nHow difficult would it be ?\r\nI am mostly seeing the case of a release after a PR is done which updates a member ...\r\n\r\n@gsmet @aloubyansky What do you think ?\r\ncc @cristianonicolai @MarianMacik \n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n_No response_",
