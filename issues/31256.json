  "body": "From what I can see, several behaviors have changed as to the model that is generated by Hibernate ORM (table-specific sequences for instance) and I'm not sure how things go if you upgrade to ORM 6 without changing your model and start your application.\r\n\r\nThis needs to be clarified and documented, especially if there are options that can easily make Hibernate ORM 6 compatible with the ORM 5-generated schema.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's a non-issue and all goes well but let's make sure of it.\r\n\r\n/cc @Sanne @beikov ",
