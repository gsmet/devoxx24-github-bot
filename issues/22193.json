  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nAs discussed on twitter with @Sanne (Hi :wave: !) I have made [available a quarkus application with a real-life JPA model consisting of 300+ entities](https://github.com/topicusonderwijs/quarkus-tribe-krd). This is quite useful to test reload performance. On my machine reloading the application in development mode takes on average 4 seconds (a 3950x/64gb/fedora linux).\r\n\r\nYou can find the code here: https://github.com/topicusonderwijs/quarkus-tribe-krd\r\n\r\n**A Bit of History**\r\n\r\nThis project is licensed under the AGPL license (because the forked project has that license). The original project was released as open source due to requirements of the public tender under which it was developed. The AGPL was picked at that time.\r\n\r\nThe model is complete for the purposes of the quarkus project, but not the complete model of the application. It was partially open sourced (only those parts that were required per the tender) in 2013-ish, so development has continued and the actual current model should be roughly 1200+ JPA classes big.\r\n\r\nThe original system is a Student Information System for vocational education (trade schools) in the Netherlands. It was expanded for college/university education as well. The JPA model in the quarkus project is a subset of all functionality, but most concepts still exist in the current application's domain, albeit expanded.\r\n\r\n**How it works**\r\n\r\nIt is just a quarkus project, so starting with `mvn quarkus:dev` should work :tm: . In the package `org.acme` is the standard quarkus hello resteasy resource. Whenever you modify this the application is reloaded by quarkus, causing Hibernate to reinitialise the JPA model.\r\n\r\nThe entities reside in the package `nl.topicus.eduarte.entities` and subpackages. Other packages exist to make the project compile and start up.\r\n\r\n**Queries?**\r\n\r\nI stripped the application of all functionality as the original code base is Hibernate 3.5.x based, and that doesn't translate well to Hibernate 5.x easily. If you wish to see how queries are created you can look at the initial commit:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/topicusonderwijs/quarkus-tribe-krd/tree/44dd1e302ce231ecca326605d51e361eb651d4db/eduarte/core/src/main/java/nl/topicus/eduarte/dao/hibernate\r\n\r\nAnd if you want to see some horror methods take a look at:\r\n\r\n- [DeelnemerHibernateDataAccessHelper](https://github.com/topicusonderwijs/quarkus-tribe-krd/blob/44dd1e302ce231ecca326605d51e361eb651d4db/eduarte/core/src/main/java/nl/topicus/eduarte/dao/hibernate/DeelnemerHibernateDataAccessHelper.java#L81), or\r\n- [VerbintenisHibernateDataAccessHelper](https://github.com/topicusonderwijs/quarkus-tribe-krd/blob/44dd1e302ce231ecca326605d51e361eb651d4db/eduarte/core/src/main/java/nl/topicus/eduarte/dao/hibernate/VerbintenisHibernateDataAccessHelper.java#L69)\r\n\r\nYou can imagine I did not port this functionality over.\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\nAs discussed with @Sanne on twitter, he told me that Hibernate developers lack real world domain models for testing Hibernate's functionality against. I knew about the existence of this code base, so I stripped it to the bare minimum to make it work in modern quarkus (the original code base is Hibernate 3.5.x iirc). I did not convert any queries or other business functionality.\r\n\r\nI have no further expectations but would like to know that you find this project useful and it helps Hibernate and Quarkus to improve startup times and other aspects, for example perhaps a Hibernate 6 API bridge between Hibernate criteria API and JPA criteria API (_one can only wish_)\r\n\r\nHave fun with this project!\r\n",
