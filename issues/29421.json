  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nWe use Quarkus and Primefaces.  \r\n\r\nSome of our objects are created with @ViewScoped which is a Myfaces construct.   This requires us to use the myfaces-quarkus extension.  While running in dev mode and deploying the application as normal, everything works fine.  \r\n\r\nWe just started to try using @QuarkusTest instead of mocking so much.  We want to inject our beans in to our tests just as they are in our application.  Everything was going smooth until we tried to inject an @Viewscoped bean.  \r\n\r\nEither it is a bug or I need to do something special with our @QuarkusTests unit tests to get the CDI to recognize @Viewscoped beans during the Surefire testing phase.  \r\n\r\nThank you so much for your help.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nMyfaces @Viewscoped beans are recognized by the Quarkus CDI in tests annotated with @QuarkusTest during Surefire Testing phase.  This assumes the use of org.apache.myfaces.core.extensions.quarkus::myfaces-quarkus is being used.  For reference, we use the version 2.3-next-M7\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n@Viewscoped beans are recognized by Quarkus during dev mode and while the application is running, but not during testings with tests annotated with @QuarkusTest.   ContextNotActive is the issue with anything injected that is @Viewscoped.\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n18.0.2\n\n### GraalVM version (if different from Java)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n2.7.1.Final\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\nmaven\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",
