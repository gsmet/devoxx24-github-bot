  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nQuarkus 2.4.x upgraded Flyway dependency to 8.0 as part of https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/20760\r\nThe problem is that Flyway 8.0 (community) does not longer support MySQL 5.7 and PostgreSQL 9.6. It fails with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.flywaydb.core.internal.license.FlywayEditionUpgradeRequiredException: Flyway Teams Edition or MySQL upgrade required: MySQL 5.7 is no longer supported by Flyway Community Edition, but still supported by Flyway Teams Edition. \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be quite problematic for users as users using the Flyway extension and MySQL 5.7 or PostgreSQL 9.6 would need to use Flyway Teams Edition (paid plan) to continue using it. \r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, we should at least make a note in the migration guide to let users know about this change.\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\n_No response_",
