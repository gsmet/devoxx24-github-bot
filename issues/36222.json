  "body": "### Description\n\nCurrently, only when the users initiate an RP-initiated logout themselves, where they click on the logout link/button, are redirected to the OIDC provider's logout endpoint, they can be redirected back to Quarkus to the configured post logout page, where, for example, they can be asked to login again by clicking on the provided link.\r\n\r\nIf it is the backchannel or frontchannel logout, the users do not press some button themselves, they find out that they have been logged out by accessing the endpoint, by immediately being redirected to the OIDC provider's authentication screen - ex, I access `/hello`, knowing I'm already authenticated, and now I'm facing Keycloak authentication screen because Keycloak admin has logged me out - but a better user experience can be where instead I'm landing at the configured post logout endpoint page.\r\n     \n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nEven though redirecting to the post logout page is not part of the back channel or front channel logout specs, what happens to the user sitting in front of the browser is simply unspecified in those specs.\r\n\r\nIf the users configure the post logout page, they should be simply redirected to it, instead of back to OIDC provider's authentication challenge page ",
