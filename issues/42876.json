  "body": "\r\nI tried to fix this, but couldn't figure out the best solution. That may be why we have the problem!\r\n\r\nThe `Fluff.yml` vale rule is extending `substitution`, but it's not actually a substitution rule - the things in the `swap` list aren't suggested before-and-after, they're problematic tokens and then explanations of what a user might want to do. \r\n\r\n```\r\nextends: substitution\r\nmessage: \"Depending on the context, consider using '%s' rather than '%s'.\"\r\nswap:\r\n  in order to: \"Be concise: use 'to' rather than\"\r\n  needs? to: \"Rewrite the sentence, or use 'must', instead of\"\r\n  note that: \"Be concise: rewrite the sentence to not use\"\r\n  recommend: \"using more direct instructions\"\r\n  respectively: \"Rewrite the sentence to be more precise, instead of using\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause of this, the messages for this rule come out as nonsense. For example, \r\n\r\n```\r\n[vale] reported by reviewdog üê∂\r\n[Quarkus.Fluff] Depending on the context, consider using 'Be concise: rewrite the sentence to not use' rather than 'note that'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe raw message makes a bit more sense, but it's still pretty confusing:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRaw Output:\r\n{\"message\": \"[Quarkus.Fluff] Depending on the context, consider using 'Be concise: rewrite the sentence to not use' rather than 'note that'.\", \"location\": {\"path\": \"docs/src/main/asciidoc/extension-maturity-model.adoc\", \"range\": {\"start\": {\"line\": 25, \"column\": 6}}}, \"severity\": \"INFO\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne possible fix is to split the `Fluff.yml` rule into a whole bunch of individual [`existence`](https://vale.sh/docs/topics/styles/#existence) rules. If we wanted to have some grouping, we could make a `fluff` super-rule and extend it.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the message could be written so that the `after` was just a sentence on its own, but that's a bit of an abuse of the `swap` data. But it would be a faster fix, and keep all of the rules grouped in one file.  \r\n\r\nWhat do you think, @michelle-purcell and @ebullient?\r\n",
