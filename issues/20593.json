  "body": "I'm having a strange error in a Gradle build that produces a Quarkus uber-jar. What I want to do in this build is to package the uber-jar created by the `quarkusBuild` task in a TAR file *after* it has been created. For this I have created a Gradle Tar task as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntasks.register('buildTar', Tar)\r\n{\r\n   // ...\r\n\r\n   mustRunAfter quarkusBuild\r\n\r\n   into('foo')\r\n   {\r\n      from quarkusBuild.runnerJar\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the uber-jar in the TAR is corrupt, and only this file (meaning that everything else in the TAR is consistent). When unpacking the uber-jar from the Tar and comparing it with the uber-jar file that is written to the `build` folder, the one in the TAR is larger (they have different sizes). Trying to run the unpacked uber-jar with `java -jar myUber.jar` results equally in errors saying it is not a valid JAR file.\r\n\r\nI was studying the code of the class `QuarkusBuild` a little. Could it be that [lines 118 to 138](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/8f312f55cefe11de7c189144bc54f2fc5090403b/devtools/gradle/gradle-application-plugin/src/main/java/io/quarkus/gradle/tasks/QuarkusBuild.java#L118) spawn a thread that executes asynchronously to the calling thread? If this is indeed the case, my explanation would be that at the time the `buildTar` tasks starts reading the uber-jar, it is not yet completely written. This would be a bad design flaw. Without further synchronization means it would be impossible to reliably post-process the output of `quarkusBuild` by subsequent tasks in a Gradle build. Or am I missing something else?",
