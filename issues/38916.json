  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nAs a follow-up to https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/38807, I think it would be very useful to be able to access lazy relations of detached entities:\r\n\r\n- Spring has \"Open session in view\".\r\n- Wildfly seems to have a similar mechanism by default (our application is migrating from Wildfly and fetching relations from detached entities somehow wasn't an issue).\r\n- Eclipselink (JPA RI) also allows to access lazy properties of detached entities by default (not even sure you can disable that).\r\n- enable_lazy_load_no_trans is mentioned in multiple sources, although I tried to activate it with quarkus.hibernate-orm.unsupported-properties.\"hibernate.enable_lazy_load_no_trans\"=true, which is actually being read, but I couldn't find any usage besides configuration in Hibernate 6.4.\r\n- [Some](https://vladmihalcea.com/the-open-session-in-view-anti-pattern/) consider it an antipattern, [others](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-open-session-in-view#2-pattern-or-anti-pattern) have a more nuanced perspective.\r\n\r\nExample use case for which it would be practically needed: chained relations, e.g.  a `Statement` has a `previousStatement`; you want to be able to fetch the previous statement, you'll maybe need the next one afterwards etc. Performance is often mentioned in the CONs, but you would end up fetching the objects one by one when needed anyway, detached entity or not, and an open-in-view mechanism wouldn't make any difference there. On the contrary, it will in some situations be more performant: the relation will only be queried from the database if/when needed instead of being fetched in all cases, eagerly or from a projection.\r\n\r\nI suggest implementing a similar feature in Quarkus.\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\n_No response_",
