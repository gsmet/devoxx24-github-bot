We need to be sure that future releases (newer lts branches and main) do not introduce regression because the component wasn't upgraded there.\r\n\r\nThe ideal flow should be through backports `main => 3.x LTS => 3.y LTS` where x>y, but sometimes direct upgrades can happen.\r\n\r\nReviewer should be notified if there is version misalignment with Quarkus main and other active branches with versions higher than the target branch of the PR.\r\n\r\nCC @gsmet \r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\nEnhancement of quarkus-bot to check if the upgraded dependency version is present (in the same or higher version) in Quarkus main and other active branches with minor versions higher than the target branch of the PR.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find any GitHub Action that would compare versions between branches.",
