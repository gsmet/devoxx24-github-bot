  "body": "### Description\n\nIssue #22808 mentions several configuration options that are either not mentioned at all or possibly not mentioned \"correctly\" in the all-config guide.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the description for the property `quarkus.locales` the following sentence is mentioned in the guide:\r\n> Native-image build uses it to define additional locales that are supposed to be available at runtime.\r\n\r\nHowever, the issue talks about `quarkus.native.locales`. I have tested this property and it works. \r\nWhich of these properties must be used and when? Are both needed at all or can one of them be removed?\r\n\r\nThe following two properties mentioned in the issue do not appear in the guide at all:\r\n```\r\nquarkus.native.user-language\r\nquarkus.native.user-country\r\n```\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n_No response_",
