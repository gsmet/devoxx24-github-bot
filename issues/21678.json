  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nSupport the ability to disable MicroProfile `ConfigSource` or SmallRye `ConfigSourceFactory` loading during build time.\r\n\r\nThe [docs](https://quarkus.io/guides/config-extending-support) say that the `ConfigSource` is not added in this phase unless annotated with `@StaticInitSafe`.  This is a good start, but only works for static init.  Would like a similar feature for build time.\r\n\r\n#### Problem Trying To Solve\r\nCurrently, there is no way (that I know of), that I can prevent logic from within a config source from being executed during build time.\r\n\r\nI have a custom `ConfigSourceFactory` which needs to make remote HTTP calls, which needs to wait until runtime to actually be executed.  It does still get executed at runtime, but it is redundantly executed at build time as well (with no added value).  The configuration values that are retrieved are stored in an in-memory cache local to the `ConfigSourceFactory` which does not survive from build time to run time.  This factory also sets up a scheduled job which periodically refreshes the configuration values from the remote server behind the scenes.\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\nONLY consider `ConfigSource` or `ConfigSourceFactory`, etc... annotated with `@StaticInitSafe` or perhaps a new `@BuildTimeSafe` to be loaded and used for configuration resolution.  All other config sources are ignored (like they don't exist) during static init phase.  It seems like this would need some integration support from MicroProfile Config / SmallRye Config to work in totality.",
