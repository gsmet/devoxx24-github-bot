  "body": "### Description\n\nThis mostly happens to me on the client, but I think it can also be useful for the server.\r\n\r\nWhen using MP REST Client via RR Client, I'm doing a call via a proxy: `someclient.someMethod()` so I don't have access to the request/response and if something goes wrong and a header is missing, or an exception is thrown or whatever, it's not trivial at all to know why, because all this is hidden from the user.\r\n\r\nI turned out to have an exceptional status code returned by my github client due to a missing header and I had to use a debugger or TCP inspector to see it, because RR was hiding that HTTP traffic from me.\r\n\r\nI think we should add an option to dump all HTTP traffic with a property:\r\n\r\n```properties\r\n# Client and Server\r\nquarkus.resteasy-reactive.dump-traffic=true\r\n# Only server\r\nquarkus.resteasy-reactive.server.dump-traffic=true\r\n# Only client\r\nquarkus.resteasy-reactive.client.dump-traffic=true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would have saved me quite a few times.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n_No response_",
