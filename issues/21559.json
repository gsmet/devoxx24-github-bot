  "body": "Scenario:\r\n1. Create a simple Quarkus REST application\r\n2. Verify that the application works locally with mvn quarkus:dev and calling your endpoint from a browser\r\n3. Add a dependency to quarkus-amazon-lambda-http\r\n4. Deploy to AWS using sam.cmd deploy (either jvm or native, it doesn't matter)\r\n5. Use a browser to test if the application works as expected by visiting the link produced by the SAM tool. Notice that whilst a request to the default index.html works fine, calls to your REST endpoints that are annotated with @GET @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) fail with HTTP 406\r\n\r\n(Actually the deployment to AWS is not required to reproduce - the problem is still evident locally with mvn quarkus:dev after adding the dependency to quarkus-amazon-lambda-http)\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be that  LambdaHttpHandler splits the HTTP Accept headers before forwarding to the application:\r\n\r\nOriginal header from the client with multiple accepted media types:\r\nAccept: text/html,application/text,\\*/\\*\r\n\r\nRequest received after LambdaHttpHandler has done its magic:\r\nAccept: text/html\r\nAccept: application/text\r\nAccept: \\*/\\*\r\n\r\nSplitting the accept header into multiple accept headers is OK from a HTTP perspective, but whichever component routes the request to the application appears to only use the *first* of these headers, so a typical REST service that can only produce application/json then responds with HTTP 406\r\n\r\nThe problem can be reproduced with non-lambda version as well with curl:\r\ncurl 'http://localhost:8080/someRestEndpoint' -H \"Accept: application/xml\" -H \"Accept: application/json\" -i -v\r\n\r\nSwitching the header order fixes or sidesteps the problem, because then application/json is first in the list.\r\ncurl 'http://localhost:8080/someRestEndpoint' -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"Accept: application/xml\"  -i -v\r\n",
