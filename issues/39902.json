  "body": "### Description\n\nWhile NTLM authentication is very outdated, some legacy systems are still using it, and integrating with those is a real challenge at the moment.\r\n\r\nIn our use case we use the reactive rest client, and it doesn't offer a way to do this authentication out of the box. Checking the documentation of the underlying eclipse.microprofile I couldn't figure the way to do that either. Afaik there's also no support for proxy with NTLM-authentication.\r\n\r\nWhile we are able to get a response from the NTLM protected server using plain Java and setting the global Authenticator state to use the constructed `PasswordAuthentication` I can't figure a way to integrate that into the quarkus rest client.\r\n\r\nIf there's no plan to support NTLM authentication, maybe someone can still share ideas on how to make that work with what's currently available? All ideas are appreciated.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n_No response_",
