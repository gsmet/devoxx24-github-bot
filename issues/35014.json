  "body": "### Description\n\nIt would be good to have a heathcheck for oidc-client. This could be optionally enabled or disabled (not sure what you want). It would alarm about oidc after the retries are over and still no connection is established.\r\nThe readiness check would work along the same lines.\r\n\r\nRational: Some applications are constantly feed data, need to transform them and send them to another service that requires an oidc token for authorization. These applications log an exception into the console atm, but in k8s they are not restarted to get back an connection.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nImplement an health and readiness check and enable it when `io.quarkus.smallrye.health` capability is present.\r\n\r\nMight need further input/configuration option what should count as healthy/ready",
