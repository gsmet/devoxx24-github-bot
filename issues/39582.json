  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nWhen working with Elasticsearch, for example through Hibernate Search, and especially when developing, it can be useful to have access to Kibana, be it just to run queries through a web UI or explore the mapping.\r\nSimilarly with OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards.\r\n\r\nKibana / OpenSearch Dashboards are also feature-packed solutions in their own right, so it could make sense to have an actual integration beyond but I'm not quite sure what kind of integrations applications can have with Kibana, if any. I suspect application usually only affect Kibana indirectly through Elasticsearch, but I may be wrong.\r\n\r\nAnyway, IMO it would be a great start if we provided either an option to launch Kibana in the Elasticsearch dev services (and include a link to it in the Dev UI), or a separate extension with just Kibana dev services that integrates with Elasticsearch dev services.\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\n_No response_",
