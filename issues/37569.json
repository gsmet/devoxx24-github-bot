  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nGoing through the [security-customization](https://quarkus.io/version/main/guides/security-customization) guide I found some issues.\r\n1. [HttpAuthenticationMechanism Customization](https://quarkus.io/version/main/guides/security-customization#httpauthenticationmechanism-customization) \r\n\\- Don't have any imports\r\n\\- There is problem with wrong return type of one of the overridden method. As not `Uni` method is deprecated I think that it should look like this\r\n```\r\n@Override\r\n    public Uni<HttpCredentialTransport> getCredentialTransport(RoutingContext context) {\r\n        return delegate.getCredentialTransport(context);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n2. [Dealing with more than one HttpAuthenticationMechanism](https://quarkus.io/version/main/guides/security-customization#dealing-with-more-than-one-http-auth-mechanisms)\r\n\\- Don't have any imports\r\n\\- The text talking about priorities but which number for them is better higher or lower. In sense when I select number 1 as in snippet will be used as last mechanism? It would be nice to have one sentence to explain this.\r\n3. [Security Identity Customization](https://quarkus.io/version/main/guides/security-customization#security-identity-customization) \r\n\\- Snippet for mtls missing import `java.util.Collections`\r\n\\- Snipet for `SecurityIdentitySupplier` missing the definition of `UserRoleEntity`. Can't say what it should contain from this.\r\n4. [Custom Jakarta REST SecurityContext](https://quarkus.io/version/main/guides/security-customization#jaxrs-security-context)\r\n\\- Snippet for mtls missing import `java.io.IOException`\r\n5. [Disabling Authorization](https://quarkus.io/version/main/guides/security-customization#disabling-authorization)\r\n\\- Don't have any imports\r\n\\- When testing this I'm not sure if this should \"disable/override\" `@RolesAllowed` and `@DenyAll` and by that allow anyone to access the endpoints.\r\n6. [SunPKCS11](https://quarkus.io/version/main/guides/security-customization#sun-pkcs11)\r\n\\- The `In Quarkus you can achieve the same at the configuration level only without having to modify the code, for example:` For me something is off with the words `only` and `without` going after each other. Maybe remove `only` or add comma between them.\r\n\r\nFor the imports: As I would prefer consistency with the imports, here are some which have the imports and some which missing all imports. It would be nice to have them consistent (at the moment have the imports)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n_No response_\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",
