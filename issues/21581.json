  "body": "### Description\n\nKeycloak and some other providers support RP-initiated logout - but many don't such as Auth0, Google, etc - they have their own custom ways of dealing with it.\r\n\r\nIf the logout is required but no `end-session` path is returned in a discovery doc - then if the user has set a logout-path property then quarkus-oidc should just delete a `q_session` (it does it now for RP initiated one and has also been discovered by @FroMage) and just redirect the user to the provided logout path.\r\n\r\nIn fact it can already work right now - but I believe the auto-discovery has to be disabled for a custom logout path to be taken into the consideration - so quite likely a very simple fix is needed  \n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n_No response_",
