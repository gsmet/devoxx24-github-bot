  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nI in fact raised the bug for which the PR was done. When I have tested it it worked fine. \r\nhttps://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/26978\r\n\r\nIn my main app, for some reason, at version 2.11.2+ (Currently running latest 2.13.3), the metrics are not showing at all in /q/metrics.\r\n\r\nI tried to build a sample dummy app, with 2.13.3 and it does work properly, I do see the client metrics and I do hit a breakpoint in the `filter` method of `RestClientMetricsFilter`\r\n\r\nWhen I test on my main app, the breakpoint does not hit.\r\n\r\nI do not know how to actually reproduce/what triggers the filter to not run. I would like any guidance on what to look at as I have no idea what could prevent the filter to execute. I have multiple rest clients in my application and for none of them the metrics work. I tried removing all custom interceptor/FT annotations from one of the rest client but result is the same.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nRestClientMetricsFilter should run and meter should be in the metrics page\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nNo rest client metrics are shown\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\nI am sorry. I am not able to have one until the root cause is found. Which I am currently unable to find.\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\nDarwin Kernel Version 21.6.0\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\nopenjdk version \"17.0.4.1\" 2022-08-12\n\n### GraalVM version (if different from Java)\n\nn/a\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n2.13.3\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\nmvn 3.8.4\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",
