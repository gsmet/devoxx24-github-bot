  "body": "### Description\n\nAssertJ is a widely-used library for fluent assertions in Java, commonly used in conjunction with testing frameworks such as JUnit â€” which Quarkus uses by default.\r\n\r\nWhile built-in JUnit assertions do the job for the most part, AssertJ provides a rich set of assertions and truly helpful error messages.\r\n\r\nThe ask in this issue is for you to consider including AssertJ with Quarkus releases so there is no need to explicitly specify the version number. This would ensure that a given, tested version of AssertJ is released alongside the other libraries included in the Maven BOM.\r\n\r\nAnother (even better!) approach could be to include it as part of `io.quarkus:quarkus-junit5`, but I'm not sure about the scope for that artifact.\r\n\r\n### Benefits:\r\n\r\n- Simplification of dependency management by reducing the need to specify version numbers\r\n- Ensures compatibility and stability by providing a tested version of AssertJ alongside other libraries\r\n- Streamlines the development process by promoting consistency in dependency management across different artifacts\r\n\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n_No response_",
