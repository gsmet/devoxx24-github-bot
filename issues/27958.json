  "body": "### Description\n\nThe narayana JTA extension provides transaction support and a key feature provided by JTA is to be able to complete prepared transactions following failures in the environment such as networking issues or JVM crashes.\r\n\r\nIssue #26160 added support for recovery but the test for is manual (https://github.com/zhfeng/quarkus-narayana-crash-recovery):\r\n1. start the quarkus app\r\n2. the app includes two resources a database and a dummy resource\r\n3. send an http request to the endpoint to crash the JVM when the dummy resource commits\r\n4. restart the quarkus app\r\n5. wait a while for recovery to kick in and verify that the JTA extension replays the failed commit request\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to be able to perform this kind of workflow using the test harness.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nI'm not familiar with the test harness but maybe it could be implemented by extending testcontainers or by enhancing QuarkusTestResourceLifecycleManager.",
