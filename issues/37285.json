  "body": "### Describe the enhancement\r\n\r\nFor RESTEasy Reactive resource\r\n\r\n```Java\r\n@Path(\"/api/users\")\r\npublic class UsersResource {\r\n\r\n    @GET\r\n    @Path(\"/me\")\r\n    @RolesAllowed(\"user\")\r\n    public User me() {\r\n        return new User(identity);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nboth HTTP request paths `/api/users/me` and `/api/users/me/` will be matched, but exact path match `quarkus.http.auth.permission.t1.paths=/api/users/me` will only match `/api/users/me`. This seems natural and we document it here https://quarkus.io/version/main/guides/security-authorize-web-endpoints-reference#authorization-using-configuration in a Warning.\r\n\r\nBut as user, I don't necessary mention every single part of documentation and it doesn't struct me that when I want to secure resource method `me` I need to add 2 path patterns. I'd go as was as argue that most of the time when you add exact path matches you want to secure both paths.\r\n\r\nAlso I dare say I don't necessary test both `/api/users/me` and `/api/users/me/`.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 ways I can see to handle this:\r\n\r\n- @maxandersen mentioned that in Nginx you can use `/api/users/me/?` to secure both paths; In that case, we would change documentation to always use ending question mark and only document with proper warning once that when question mark is missing, one path is secured. \r\n- I suggest to secure both paths by default and only allow to override this _security first_ approach with exclamation mark, like `/api/users/me!` would mean you really want to secure only one path. However that would be breaking change and I can't see it being accepted.\r\n",
