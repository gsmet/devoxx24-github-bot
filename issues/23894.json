  "body": "### Description\n\nWe are using quarkus for aws lambda together with dynamodb,\r\nand dev experience with dynamodb looks frustrating comparing with traditional datasour—Åes.\r\nFor datasources there are out of the box perfect dev-mode support and QuarkusTests - db container (or in-mem db) is started under the hood with zero-config, + easy db structure creation with liquibase or flyway.\r\n\r\nBut for dynamodb there is nothing like that at all: for dev mode you have to manually start docker container with ddb and create tables. For tests you have to write you custom QuarkusTestResource with Testcontainers.\r\nIt would be super-nice to have ddb container starting for dev and test profiles and automatically configured for default client (and somehow create tables, but don't know how to describe that).\r\nAlso, named datasources support is nice to have, similar to datasources...\r\n\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n1. QuarkusTest DDB support out of the box: start testcontainer and configure default ddb client (similar to QuarkusTestResource in quick-starts)\r\n2. Start DDB container for dev-mode.\r\n3. Would be nice to have standard way to provide ddb tables structure for dev and test modes (like it works with liquibase for datasources)\r\n4. Named DDB clients support for the use-cases when it's required to access dynamodb from different accounts or with different credentials.\r\n\r\ndynamodb-quickstart using local-stack container for running dynamodb. But it's very slow. it takes up to 10 seconds just to start container. Consider using dynamodb-local or dynalite container, they are 10 times faster.",
