The current implementation(microprofile) uses the fully qualified metrics names. For example, if I have a metrics with name \"totalCount\" in the class com.org.github.MicrometerMetrics the way I am accessing the metrics is by using the key: \"**com.org.github.MicrometerMetrics.totalCount**\"\r\nWhen I switched to micrometer the default names of metrics changes from the fully qualified names to just the metrics name. Meaning now I have to access the metrics using the key: \"**totalCount**\"\r\nThis makes the migration complex as I would have to change the name of the metrics to make them meaningful without the fully qualified name and also I have to change the keys to access the metrics\r\n\r\nIs there a way in micrometer to get the metrics by fully qualified names which include package name and class name along with the metrics name?</div>",
