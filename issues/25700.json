  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nHi,\r\nI'm not sure what is interesting because targed for Quarkus is cloud native but let's discuss because this feature already implemented by me year ago for JVM/Native modes and need to add only Quarkus integration.\r\n \r\n**Disclaimer:**\r\nI will deliberately simplify the description of feature to better undersanding of community because embedded systems it's separated world.\r\n\r\n**Intro:**\r\nat this moment all embedded systems devided by 2 big groups - simple devices (like teapot) with small chipsets(like STM32*) and something like RTOS on board and more poverfull devices with Linux(OpenWRT, Armbian, Android, etc). In second group I can include your home router/repeater, mobile phone, drone and a lot of other devices).\r\nTo better undersanding of these devices - good example is Raspberry Pi.\r\n\"Old school\" guys can understand what hardware in RPI4 more powerfull what we have in enterprise servers 10-15 years ago :) (it's if you want to ask question about java and performance).\r\n\r\nTechnically Oracle tried to intoduce embedded in J2ME and in https://openjdk.java.net/projects/dio/ but both projects was hardcoded to specific hardware and looks like dead at this moment.\r\n\r\n**What will be implemented:**\r\nAccess to [SPI bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface)\r\nAccess to [I2C bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C)\r\nAccess to [Serial(USB/COM/etc)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication)\r\nin JVM/native without any dependency to vendor hardware. Library will re-use linux drivers for HW.\r\n\r\nLimitation:\r\nOnly Linux platforms[tested in Raspberrian/Armbian/Ubuntu in Broadcom/Allwinner chipset at this moment].\r\n\r\nIs it interesting?\r\nI propose to implement this feature in quarkiverse project\r\n\r\n### Configuration suggestion\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
