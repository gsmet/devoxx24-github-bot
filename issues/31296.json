  "body": "### Description\n\nKubernetes labels are immutable. Thus, having non-stable labels (such as a version) is very problematic when upgrading.\r\nThis should be part of the same effort as: \r\n* #15473\r\n* #26928 \r\n\r\nHere is a real use-case for which this label is highly problematic. I have a kubernetes operator built with Java Operator SDK. Having those changing labels (especially the version) makes it impossible to use the Operator Framework: when upgrading through operator framework, the `InstallPlan` fails with \"field is immutable\".  (see https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/issues/1608).\r\n\r\nI was able to avoid the issue by setting `quarkus.kubernetes.add-version-to-label-selectors=false` which incidentally removed the version label,  but this behaviour has changed in #30100 . It now still adds the version label, just not uses it in the selector... I cannot find another workaround, and believe that the ability to control the labels added is useful in many cases.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nPossible implementations were already proposed for annotations, which could be reused for labels as well (see #15473)",
