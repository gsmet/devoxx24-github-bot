  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nThe documentation [for how to deploy a Quarkus based AWS Lambda](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/main/docs/src/main/asciidoc/amazon-lambda.adoc#deploy-to-aws-lambda-custom-native-runtime) mentions that when deploying a lambda, the DISABLE_SIGNAL_HANDLERS=true environment variable needs to be set.\r\n\r\nHowever, it doesn't explain anything about why this is needed or reference any documentation about what this does exactly. It's in the section about deploying a custom (native) runtime, so I'm wondering whether this env variable is only needed in case of native executables? Will it do harm if set in lambdas that are using the JVM runtime? Also, I'm unclear on what, exactly, this env variable is effecting. Is Quarkus itself reacting to it or is it something in the aws-lambda-java-runtime-interface-client or maybe even GraalVM? Linking to some documentation about this thing would be very helpful.\r\n\r\nA [discussion about this on Zulip](https://quarkusio.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/187030-users/topic/Clarification.20in.20the.20quarkus-amazon-lambda.20documentation) even suggested that this environment variable might perhaps be outdated and not having any effect anymore.\r\n\r\nA clarification on this in the documentation (or simply removing it if the env variable has no effect) would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\n_No response_",
