  "body": "### Description\n\nFor some context, see #22025 \r\n\r\nEssentially, I am asking that the server running for @QuarkusTest be more smartly configured, in reference to Profiles, Lifecycle Managers, and the Lifecycle Manager arguments.\r\n\r\nIn my use case, I have two profiles, that need different arguments passed to the LifecycleManager to have different things spun up for different tests. Important note here is that with some arguments, the config values given will break other tests. These breaking configs are applied to all tests.\r\n\r\nThe current solution is to apply `restrictToAnnotatedClass = true` to all tests that have the manager configured to provide the arguments that break things. However, this is an imperfect solution as it requires:\r\n\r\n - all tests for the different profile to have applied\r\n - all tests for the different profile to spin up resources again for each test class\r\n\r\nI would suggest that the code handles when the Quarkus server is started back up based on `@TestProfile` also considers `@QuarkusTestResource`, where if that resource annotation is different then a new service with the new lifecycle manager setup is started. I feel the caveat of \"you should order your tests appropriately\" is acceptable, and something I have another enhancement request for here at #22072 to make easier.\r\n\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n_No response_",
