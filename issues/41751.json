  "body": "### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nREST client doesn't send the body in the redirect request after a 307 redirect from a POST request.\r\nIt happens both with `RedirectHandler` and the new `AdvancedRedirectHandler`.\r\n\r\nThe RFC says nothing about the body, however it seems the body should be sent again in the redirect request.\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/307\r\n> The method and the body of the original request are reused to perform the redirected request.\r\n> [...]\r\n> The only difference between 307 and [302](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/302) is that 307 guarantees that the method and the body will not be changed when the redirected request is made.\r\n\r\nhttps://http.dev/307\r\n> The 307 Temporary Redirect status code works the same way that the [302 Found](https://http.dev/302) status code does, except that 307 Temporary Redirect status code specifically guarantees that the HTTP method and message body will not be changed in the follow-up HTTP request.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nREST client send the original request body in the redirect request after a 307 response.\r\n\r\n- POST /x with body {...}\r\n- Response: HTTP 307 with \"Location\" header\r\n- POST /newlocation with body {...}\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nREST client doesn't the original request body in the redirect request after a 307 response.\r\n\r\n- POST /x with body {...}\r\n- Response: HTTP 307 with \"Location\" header\r\n- POST /newlocation (no body)\r\n\r\n### How to Reproduce?\r\n\r\nReproducer: https://github.com/jdussouillez/quarkus-rest-client-post-redirect-post/tree/quarkus-v3.13\r\n\r\n- Run the server\r\n- Run the client, it fails with HTTP 400 because the body is `null`\r\n\r\nUsing `curl` it works fine as the body is transferred to the redirect request.\r\n\r\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Output of `java -version`\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Quarkus version or git rev\r\n\r\n3.12.1 + current main branch (7e98e77)\r\n\r\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThis issue was first reported on another issue: https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/35126#issuecomment-2213814084\r\n",
