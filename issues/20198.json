  "body": "### Description\n\nCurrently, when a critical (unhandled) error occurs in a REST endpoint, we generate a default response with HTTP status 500 and an HTML webpage describing the error. This is done in `QuarkusErrorHandler`.\r\n\r\nWhile I doubt this matters in production, it can be really annoying when developing, as you perform an HTTP request through `curl`, and you get dozens of lines of HTML in response, right in your terminal.\r\n\r\nIf your request includes an `Accept: application/json` header, you will get JSON in the response; however, by default, you will get HTML.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n**At least in test/dev mode**, we could change the default content type of the response. When an error happens:\r\n\r\n* If there is an `Accept` header mentioning `text/html`, `application/xhtml+xml` or `application/xml`, we return HTML.\r\n* If there is an `Accept` header mentioning `application/json`, we return JSON.\r\n* If there isn't any `Accept` header, or if it doesn't mention any supported content-type, we default to some human-readable format. Maybe `application/json`, or maybe just `text/plain`.\r\n\r\nMy reasoning: all clients that could potentially render HTML (browsers) will probably send an `Accept: text/html` header. \r\nSo if we don't find one, it's probably a human directly requesting something. Or a badly configured REST client, but in that case getting JSON or plain text won't be much worse to get plain text than HTML.",
