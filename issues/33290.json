  "body": "### Description\r\nRecently,m we had multiple issues when building native executables using the builder images (so without using a locally-installed GraalVM). Typically, the container may not have access to the host file system. \r\n\r\nWhen building a native executable using these builder images, a volume is mounted (generally `target`), so the compiler has access to the files it needs to compile, and write the produced executable. For these reasons, the compiler must have read and write access to the mounted volume.\r\n\r\nThe builder image defines a `user` to avoid running as `root`. This user has the id 1001. The files created by the container belong to that user, which does not work, as the host user is rarely 1001. Thus, when launching the container, we pass a `--user` parameter overriding the last `user` from the container. This user should be the user from the local host so the graalvm compiler can read the files and write the outcome permissions allowing the host user to access the file.\r\n\r\nThis epic is about a test campaign to be sure Quarkus supports OOTB the most _pupluar_ container environments and variants:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Rootful Docker on Linux\r\n- [ ] Rootless Docker on Linux\r\n- [ ] Docker for Mac\r\n- [ ] Docker for Windows\r\n- [ ] Rootful Podman on Linux\r\n- [ ] Rootless Podman on Linux\r\n- [ ] Rootful Podman on Mac\r\n- [ ] Rootless Podman on Mac\r\n- [ ] Rootful Podman on Windows\r\n- [ ] Rootless Podman on Windows\r\n\r\nThe test is relatively simple. It just needs to run a native compilation using; for example, the getting started Quarkus application. \r\n\r\nThese tests should work with the Mandrel builder image and GraalVM builder image. \r\n\r\nSome of these tests can be automated using GitHub actions. See:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/marketplace/actions/rootless-docker\r\n\r\n## Expected outcome\r\n\r\n- We may need to tweak the discovery of some of these environments and pass the right `--user` value\r\n\r\n## Additional tasks\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful to allow the builder image to detect when the passed user is incorrect and immediately fails with a meaningful error message. @n1hility had some ideas about the implementation of such a check. \r\n",
