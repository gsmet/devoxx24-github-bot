  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nHi all,\r\nRecently in one of our projects, we introduced Lambda Snapstart with the help of the Quarkus Snapstart optimisation. The problem is that, with using Hibernate ORM together with Panache, I couldn't find a way to re-establish the database connection for my entities. Snapstart stores the state of my Lambda, with the database connection. This connection goes stale after some time. When using the state created by Snapstart, the connection is used again resulting in connection problems. After a few seconds, when the connection is re-established, I can do another request and everything works as expected.\r\n\r\nWithout Snapstart, it takes around 10 seconds to start up the Lambda and finish the request. With Snapstart, this is reduced to 2 seconds, but the first connection with the database cannot be made. This wasn't a problem without Snapstart. \r\n\r\nAny tips?\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nExecuting calls from a Snapstart state to a database for the first time.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nA stale database connection which fails the first time, but succeeds after a few seconds of being warm.\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n1. Enable Snapstart on a Lambda that makes a call do a database\r\n2. Use the Snapstart state on next request\r\n3. First request should fail and after a few seconds, requests are succeeding\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\nopenjdk version \"17.0.5\" 2022-10-18\n\n### GraalVM version (if different from Java)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n2.16.3.Final\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\nApache Maven 3.8.6 (84538c9988a25aec085021c365c560670ad80f63)\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",
