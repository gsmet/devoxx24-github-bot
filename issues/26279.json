  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nWhen running integration tests (`@QuarkusIntegrationTest`), we execute tests against a native build of the application, one that was built with the `prod` configuration profile. The main reason for that is that a native build takes a lot of time, and doing two native builds of the application (once with the `prod` profile, once with the `test` profile) would add unreasonable overhead.\r\n\r\nThis sometimes leads to confusing behavior, e.g. some configuration properties such as `%test.quarkus.hibernate-orm.sql-load-script` or  `%test.quarkus.hibernate-search-orm.automatic-indexing.synchronization.strategy` being ignored in native integration tests.\r\n\r\nWhile I think this limitation is acceptable for build-time properties, I also think we would get much better user experience by at least applying *runtime* `%test` properties when running (native) integration tests, as most people probably expect.\r\n\r\nTechnically it should be doable as it wouldn't require to re-build the application, and it would certainly make configuration more intuitive.\r\n\r\nWhile we're at it, we could even consider displaying warnings when starting the (native) integration tests if the developer tried to set build-time properties in the `%test` profile.\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\n_No response_",
