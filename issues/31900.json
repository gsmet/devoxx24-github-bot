  "body": "### Description\n\nI am building a quarkus application, however it is running through internal network, and in order to access public system i have to first go through our network proxy. For rest client this was achievable because there is a config for that. However for connections that do not go through Rest-Client  there is no way to configure them. May we please have a way of configuring Proxy for the whole application like there is in spring. e.g quarkus.proxy.host=<host>, quarkus.proxy.port=<port>, quarkus.proxy.username=<username>, quarkus.proxy.password=<pass>. Currently there seems to be forwarding of headers however we need to to be able to configure the mentioned above.  If there is currently a way of doing this which i am not aware of please let me know. Thank you.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n_No response_",
