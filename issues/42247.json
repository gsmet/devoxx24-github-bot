  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nHibernate ORM is moving its Derby dialect to \"community dialects\": https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-18037\r\n\r\nIn practice, this means using Hibernate ORM with Derby requires an extra Maven dependency, which other supported databases don't require.\r\n\r\nI was told this decision stems from Apache Derby not being very active anymore; @sebersole may be able to answer questions about this.\r\nFrom what I can see it does indeed not seem very active, since [it got 3 releases in the past 4 years](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.apache.derby/derby/versions), addressing [22 issues total over those 3 releases / 4 years](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-7110?jql=project%20%3D%20DERBY%20AND%20fixVersion%20in%20(10.15.2.0%2C%2010.16.1.1%2C%2010.17.1.0)%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20updated%20DESC).\r\n\r\nQuestion is: how do we address this in Quarkus?\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\nWays forward in Quarkus itself when we'll upgrade to Hibernate ORM 7.0:\r\n\r\n* Add a dependency to `hibernate-community-dialects` in the Hibernate ORM extension, and suffer from the potential impact on application size on disk, but preserve the feature as is.\r\n* Introduce a new, unsupported extension for Hibernate ORM community dialects, and move Apache Derby support there. I would put the extension in the Quarkiverse, and call for someone interested in Derby support to maintain it. We could potentially move JDBC support for Derby to the Quarkiverse too (maybe to the same repository?)\r\n* Suggestions?",
