  "body": "### Description\n\nRight now, when building a maven reactor which contains a module A, which is a multi-release artifact/JAR denoted by a MANIFEST.MF containing `Multi-Release: true`, it is not possible to run a Quarkus unit test in module B which depends on module A, because the Quarkus classloader will construct a class path element to the classes directory of module A instead of referring to the JAR file.\r\n\r\nIf it were using a JAR file, everything would be fine, because the `JarFile` API handles multi-release JARs transparently, but with a directory, there is no multi-release handling.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nMy suggestion is to make https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/main/independent-projects/bootstrap/core/src/main/java/io/quarkus/bootstrap/classloading/DirectoryClassPathElement.java aware of multi-release artifacts in the same way as the `JarFile` implementation does it and hence make it possible to properly test multi-release modules that are part of the workspace.",
