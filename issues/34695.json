  "body": "### Description\n\nThere is a lot of configuration properties important for smooth integration in a deployment, for instance `quarkus.application.name`, `quarkus.http.non-application-root-path` and various properties related to metrics endpoints like `quarkus.micrometer.export.prometheus.path`. Unfortunately many of these properties are fixed at build time, which makes the integration unnecessarily inflexible.\r\n\r\nIn our particular case we have a deployment consisting of tens services implemented in a few different languages, but we strive to make them follow similar patterns like exposing metrics on the same path â€“ this simplifies maintenance of the deployment a lot. Having the path in the confguration for all the components allows us to have fairly unified deployment templates and control such properties easily and with a unified metrics path we do not have to specify the metrics endpoint per service for Prometheus.\r\n\r\nI wonder why these properties are fixed at build time anyway ðŸ¤”\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nMake configuration properties that affect integration with other components actually configurable for a deployment rather then fixed at build time.\r\n\r\nIf fixing a property in build time brings significant benefits, it might be worth providing a general mechanism to specify if a property should be built-time or not. For instance, it might be provided as another (built-time) property like this, which would make `quarkus.application.name` not fixed at build time:\r\n\r\n```\r\n%%config.quarkus.application.name=runtime\r\n```\r\n",
