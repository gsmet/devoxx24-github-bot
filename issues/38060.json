  "body": "### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nHi, \r\nwe are handling updates to our readmodels event-based. We have a trigger to bulk-update all (or part of) our data, if necessary. This is where we realised that some events are not handled when using `@Blocking` or `@RunOnVirtualThread`. We have to use `@Blocking`, since we are performing database actions.\r\n\r\nI have added a small reproducer, you will find the how to reproduce in the readme.\r\nPlease note that the reproducer is more verbose than actually needed, since I have mimicked our code structure to be sure we don't do something very stupid. \r\n\r\nThere is a simple counter, counting the processed events. This perfectly **fails** to count all events. Unfortunately, it does still process all records, I wasn't able to reproduce that.\r\n\r\nI am still opening this issue, because it's rather difficult for me to trust the way we handle our events, if the count is off/different. Please note that the count is already off for small numbers of records, so it doesn't seem to be linked to the amount...\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nPaging through records and sending the IDs as events for \"someone\" to handle them, handles all events.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nIn the reproducer: The event count is different between NonBlocking, Blocking and RunOnVirtualThread. The processed records still end up being in the database\r\n\r\nIn our system: Also the processed records fail, but there is more complex logic behind.\r\n\r\n### How to Reproduce?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/thiswatch/event-reproducer\r\n\r\nCheck out readme\r\n\r\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Output of `java -version`\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Quarkus version or git rev\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_",
