  "body": "### Description\n\nI noticed that starting with 2.7.0 Continuous testing got much slower as in 2.6.3 version. I have to wait a lot more to get results after some changes have been done in the code.\r\n\r\nSince nothing seems to happen in the console after code changes, I press 'r' or 'f' and then get the message that re-running of the tests is already in progress. To avoid that, please add at least a message in the console, which indicates that the re-run has started. \n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n_No response_",
