  "body": "### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nI spotted two issues with `@TestTemplate` and dev mode, while adding tests to improve our coverage in this area. \r\n\r\n*Problem 1:* Changing a file covered by a templated test does not trigger a re-run of the templated test. \r\n\r\n*Problem 2:* Failures in templated tests are under-counted; in my test, when things pass, there are two passes, but when things fail, there's only one failure. (In normal mode, the expected two failures are reported, so this is a dev and test-mode thing.)\r\n\r\n### How to Reproduce?\r\n\r\nThe disabled [`testThatChangesTriggerRerunsOfJUnitTestTemplates`](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/40773/files#diff-c8d6cbd031069f059263db7a1a9f9f4c2f75528e519791926521e3dd35d72604R607-R642) test in `DevMojoIT` reproduces the problem. ([PR](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/40773).)\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to reproduce manually (once that PR merges). \r\n\r\n1. Run the maven tests (this just does the substitutions in the test projects): `mvn -f integration-tests/maven -Dtest=DevMojoIT clean verify`\r\n2. In one terminal, run the test application `cd integration-tests/maven/target/test-classes/projects/test-template-processed && quarkus dev`. It should report two tests passing. \r\n3. In a separate window, edit the java file for the generated test project: `vi integration-tests/maven/target/test-classes/projects/test-template-processed/src/main/java/org/acme/HelloResource.java`. Change \"hello\" to something else. \r\n4. Notice that the tests do not re-run. This is bad. \r\n5. If you quit quarkus and then re-run `quarkus dev`, you'll get failure (which is good), but only one (which is unexpected). \r\n\r\nWhen reproducing, these tests can sometimes get into an unclean state where they fail with `Wrong Name` linker/compiler errors, and in those cases `rm -rf integration-tests/maven/target/test-classes/projects/*/target` can fix it (a maven clean doesn't clean those out).",
