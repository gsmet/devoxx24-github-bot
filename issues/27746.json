  "body": "### Description\n\nWith Spring MVC, it is possible to use placeholders with Path configurations. In `@RequestMapping(\"${myapp.path}\")` the placeholder will be replaced with the myapp.path property.\r\n\r\nWhen looking for a similar feature in Quarkus (or really any feature to dynamically configure the path of a specific endpoint) I was informed that currently no such feature exists in quarkus.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't know how to go about this. I realize that this might open a whole can of worms since if it would even remotely be like SpEL so I'm open to really any way that conveniently lets people configure a path from properties, environment variables or both, be it a quarkus feature or a neat workaround.",
