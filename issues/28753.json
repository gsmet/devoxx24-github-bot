  "body": "### Description\n\nhttps://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/28476 introduced type-safe fragments, with the following syntax on the Java side:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @CheckedTemplate\r\n    public static class Templates {\r\n        public static native TemplateInstance items(List<Item> items);\r\n\r\n        @CheckedFragment\r\n        static native TemplateInstance items$price(Item item);\r\n\r\n        @CheckedFragment\r\n        static native TemplateInstance items$priceEdit(Item item);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe semantics is that a method named `foo$bar` refers to the fragment with identifier `bar` defined in the `foo.html` file. The `$` sign is used as separator to distinguish the template file and the identifier. This is required because using simply the `foo` part as the method name would introduce a clash with the containing template declaration, and using only the `bar` part could also clash with a similarly named method defined for a template called `bar.html` (even if we distinguished it with `@CheckedFragment(inside = \"foo\")`).\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the presence of `$`, being required due to the above, is enough to denote that we're talking about a fragment, and thus the `@CheckedFragment` annotation is boilerplate and should be removed. @mkouba argues that it's more explicit, but IMO the `$` stands out enough by itself.\r\n\r\nNow, on the other side of things, we have the following syntax for declaring fragments:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n{#fragment id=price}\r\n something\r\n{/fragment}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think it's a mistake to denote the ID as something that looks like a symbol, because it's not consistent with other Qute expressions. Indeed, the Qute reference doesn't even mention symbols as a possible literal: https://quarkus.io/guides/qute-reference#literals so this looks like we're using the `price` variable as ID, which is very confusing. As such, I think the ID should be defined as a String value:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n{#fragment id='price'}\r\n something\r\n{/fragment}\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n_No response_",
