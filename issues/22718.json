  "body": "### Describe the bug\r\n\r\n`WebJarResourceIT` fails on CI from time to time, scenario always passes in JVM mode\r\n\r\nDiscussed in https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/22610 a bit, it's strange that this happens only sometimes. I checked few PRs and some are green, some have this test failed. In my local experiments - I did 15 runs in a row and the tests always pass. PR with WebJarResourceIT was green too.\r\n\r\nI don't think there is something wrong with the test, failure of webjars-locator native test feels like a bug, but I can't really reproduce it and investigate it.\r\n\r\nThis needs somebody with better native image experience to investigate further. \r\n\r\nWhen the test fails, it's on the first check - `RestAssured.get(\"/webjars/jquery/jquery.min.js\").then().statusCode(200);`, 404 gets returned.\r\nhttps://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/main/integration-tests/webjars-locator/src/test/java/io/quarkus/it/webjar/locator/WebJarResourceTest.java#L17\r\nAs if the resources were not bundled into native image?\r\n\r\n",
