  "body": "`quarkus-credentials` is not a true extension: it is just a lib jar with the `CredentialsProvider` API (and an util that should probably be made API too as it's useful when you work with `CredentialsProvider`).\r\n\r\nHowever, it has a `quarkus-credentials-deployment` artifact and this artifact is actually useful as it's supposed to make the `CredentialProvider` beans unremovable.\r\n\r\nThis artifact is used for some of the extensions it's used but not all because we don't check anything given this is not a real extension.\r\n\r\nI'm leaning towards making it an extension but that means that when external jars are depending on the runtime, it will come with Quarkus infra, whereas at the moment it only comes with the ArC core library (not the extension, the ArC library itself).\r\nI can see how this could be convenient as you can implement a `CredentialsProvider` without depending on Quarkus at all but I'm not sure it's worth breaking how our extensions are made.\r\nAnd it would probably make a bit more sense if it wasn't using ArC but only CDI as ArC makes no sense outside of Quarkus atm.\r\n\r\nI'm not exactly sure how to fix that and if making it a full extension will be practical for everyone.\r\n\r\n/cc @geoand @aloubyansky @yrodiere @sberyozkin @cescoffier ",
