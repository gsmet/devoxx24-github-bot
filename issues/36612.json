  "body": "Hello,\r\nI want to use the Panache's repository pattern. But extending the `PanacheRepository` doesn't provide transactional operations. For example, the following repository:\r\n \r\n    @ApplicationScoped\r\n    public class BookRepository implements PanacheRepository<Book> {}\r\n\r\nwon't provide me with a transactional `persist()` operation. Accordingly, I have to override all the required write only methods in `PanacheRepository` in order to add `@Transactional` to them. And there are a lot of them. How could I get transactional write only operations from the `PanacheRepository` while avoiding having to override all these methods ?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nNicolas",
