  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nA prototype is available here: [quarkus-form-mfa](https://github.com/aaronanderson/quarkus-form-mfa)\r\n\r\nThis optional extension would satisfy industry standard MFA requirements for Quarkus web applications where the built-in authentication mechanisms are insufficient and OIDC configuration is impractical. The ideal uses for this extension is for administrative web applications where there is a limited number of users or to provide a native bypass authentication method into a web application in case a self-administrated OIDC configuration is invalid and is no longer functional.\r\n\r\nKey Features:\r\n\r\n* An encrypted cookie is used to track authentication state, similar to the form based authentication mechanism\r\n* A [JWE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Encryption) [JWT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token), similar to the OIDC ID Token except encrypted, is saved as a cookie and is used to track authentication state.\r\n* As a user proceeds through the authentication flow the authentication context JWE is eventually upgraded to an authenticated session cookie, similar to the cookie set by the OIDC extension.\r\n* Time Based One-Time Password ([TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password)) support\r\n* Plugable Identity Store implementations allow interactions with back-end Cloud database user stores\r\n* Account Lock\r\n* Password Reset\r\n* TOTP QR Code Key Registration\r\n* TOTP Passcode Validation\r\n* Application provided login and log out presentation pages\r\n* [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) presentation support allowing views to be rendered based on the login state\r\n* Single Page Application ([SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)) Support\r\n    * The authentication action controller supports both HTML form encoding and JSON\r\n    * SPAs can perform a GET request to obtain details about the current authentication state\r\n    * Based on authentication state SPAs can post login attempts, password resets, or TOTP passcode validation requests and respond accordingly based on the result. \r\n    * The authentication context cookie gets updated identically to the forms based login mechanism\r\n\r\n### Repository name\r\n\r\nquarkus-form-mfa\r\n\r\n### Short description\r\n\r\nEnhanced Form Based Authentication with TOTP MFA for both HTML and JSON based authentication\r\n\r\n### Repository Homepage URL\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/aaronanderson/quarkus-form-mfa\r\n\r\n### Repository Topics\r\n\r\n- quarkus-extension\r\n- MFA\r\n- Authentication\r\n...\r\n\r\n\r\n### Team Members\r\n\r\n- @aaronanderson\r\n\r\n\r\n### GitHub Applications?\r\n\r\n- [ ] [Stale](https://github.com/marketplace/stale) - Automatically close stale Issues and Pull Requests that tend to accumulate during a project\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
