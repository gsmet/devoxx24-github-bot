  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently the the behaviour is to stop processing/consuming. Which then requires restart of the application, be it manual or through devops health checks automation.\r\n\r\nAlso what is not clear when the application is restarted if it goes back to that messages offset and it's a true \"poison pill\" then technically speaking you will never be able to get past that record or when the application is restarted it skips to latest offset then there a chance you miss processing records? (This happened recently to us, where the consumer unregistered we restarted the app and any new record behind the records that got stuck where just skipped because the app started at the \"latest\" offset)\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if when this warning happens, that we have the option to DLQ the message and then let us decide wether it goes into a retry mechanism or just stays DLQ. So the processing can continue.\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\n_No response_",
