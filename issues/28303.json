  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nI have hit a strange issue that Quarkus requires `{` and `}` to be URL-encoded in the query param value.. Seems that different clients choose different behavior wrt encoding those chars, and it's kind of a gray area.. There are bunch of RFCs that define different approaches, and the [WHATWG (URL) standards](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/) that specifies that for query params these chars does not have to be encoded.\r\n\r\nSome clients, for example Postman (from version `8.0` and up), will not URL encode the `{` and `}` when those are in the query param value. In the same way, some HTTP server implementations do not require those to be encoded. With Quarkus, any HTTP request that has `{` or `}` non encoded in the query value will fail with `400`. \r\n\r\nNow I am not interested here in going into deeper discussion on what's the right approach. But the previous HTTP server implementation we used allowed those chars to be not-encoded and our new services are now failing those requests. This means we are breaking the backward-compatibility in a way.\r\n\r\nI would like to know if there is any way to change this behavior? Any property, specification, anything that we could quickly use to fix the issue. Any solution is fine, maybe an interceptor that can perform additional encoding or something like this :pray:  \r\n   \n\n### Expected behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n_No response_\n\n### GraalVM version (if different from Java)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n2.12.3.Final\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",
