  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nWhen the Gradle cache is enabled, the Gradle integration tests fail when a Gradle task is run and returns \"FROM-CACHE\" as its status, because the test is looking for the \"SUCCESS\" string. The \"FROM-CACHE\" means that Gradle recognizes the build environment and the task inputs and had enough confidence to reuse the task outputs from the last run.\r\n\r\nThis issue is low priority, in my opinion, as it is somewhat cosmetic, and it only happens if incubating features are used.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, there's two ways to think about this:\r\n- You do not have confidence (yet?) in Gradle's caching abilities, and don't want to invest in supporting it just yet. This is fair; Gradle's cache has been reliable _for me_ but that's by no means proof that it's working as intended for these tests.\r\n- Gradle's caching of these tests could be checked to make sure there are no issues, then the tests could be fixed to accept the \"FROM-CACHE\" status result, even if not enabled by default.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe integration tests pass.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nSome of the integration tests fail, reporting that the Gradle status \"FROM-CACHE\" does not equal \"SUCCESS\".\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Append \"org.gradle.caching=true\" to ~/.gradle/gradle.properties (possibly also is fine to place in \"integration-tests/gradle/gradle.properties\" file as well)\r\n2. Run `./mvnw -Dquickly && ./mvnw -f integration-tests/gradle/ install`\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\nLinux jacob-ubuntu-dev 5.15.0-30-generic #31-Ubuntu SMP Thu May 5 10:00:34 UTC 2022 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\nopenjdk version \"11.0.15\" 2022-04-19 OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.15+10-Ubuntu-0ubuntu0.22.04.1) OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.15+10-Ubuntu-0ubuntu0.22.04.1, mixed mode, sharing)\n\n### GraalVM version (if different from Java)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n3bd0588c1c53bd0bf303bde40cac74ba78482680 (or, main as of this morning)\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\nApache Maven 3.8.4 (9b656c72d54e5bacbed989b64718c159fe39b537)\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",
