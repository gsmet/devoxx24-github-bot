  "body": "### Description\n\nCurrently Quarkus devmode expects applications to use a limited set of libraries (RESTEasy, SR Reactive Messaging) to work efficiently and have a much faster feedback loop.\r\n\r\nBut for services that are not using them, and for working on tasks where API calls are not involved, eg. with custom messaging queue implementations or scheduled events, it means that the application needs to go through a complete restart for every change to be able to get feedback. \r\nIn these cases the significantly longer start times of devmode is not compensated by fast reloads as there is nothing to trigger them currently.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n- There could be an accessible way eg. with a method level runtime annotation, like `@HotReloadTrigger` that would flag the method to trigger a hot-reload when called.\r\n- Or alternatively a bit less accessible workaround could be to have a comprehensive guide on how to write wrappers/extensions that would trigger the reload for our existing code.",
