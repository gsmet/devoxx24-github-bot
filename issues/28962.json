  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nI have written unittests for my crud service which are annotated with ```@QuarkusTest```. I can easily debug these from within Intellij. For some of these tests I have also written some mockservices using alternatives which are injected instead of the real services.\r\n\r\nI've also written some integrationtests, annotated with ```@QuarkusIntegrationTest```. However, when I debug these from Intellij, I'm not able to debug the underlying code. I'm using restassured to post or get some messages and I can debug through the test, but not through the underlying service code itself. Is there a way to also debug the underlying code being called? I've put some system outs in the code, but I dont' see these being logged anywhere.\r\n\r\nI've also tried using ```@QuarkusTest``` for my integration tests, but then I run into problem again that the mocked services are being used instead of the real services; for my integration tests I want the real services to be used and not the mocks. I think using ```@QuarkusIntegrationTest``` is also better to use, because it runs against the native code and we can use the native profile in our build process, which only triggers the integration tests after the native image has been build.\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\n_No response_",
