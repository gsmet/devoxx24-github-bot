  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/32860 introduced Ansible guide recently. This guide describes deployment of Quarkus application built from sources and targeting JVM mode.\r\n\r\nI have several ideas for enhancements:\r\n\r\n**0) OS**\r\nThere is no info about target OS, systemd service indicates RHEL, Fedora to me. Maybe this could be clarified a bit.\r\n\r\n**1) JDK**\r\nThe guide talks about OpenJDK being required. What about Temurin, Corretto, etc. ?\r\n`java-17-openjdk` in mentioned in the listing. Is Java 11 allowed too?\r\nMaybe it would be worth having a hint how to install JDK using Ansible.\r\n\r\n**2) Native mode**\r\nCan be `middleware_automation.quarkus.playbook` used to build and deploy Quarkus application as native binary?\r\n\r\n**3) Deploy of container image**\r\nUse-case: the app is already built and deployed into internal/external registry by a CI pipeline\r\nCan be Ansible used to deploy such container into target environment and the containerized app executed as a service?\r\n\r\n**4) Deploy from (maven) repository**\r\nUse-case: the app is already built and deployed into internal/external (not only maven) repository by a CI pipeline\r\nCan be Ansible used to deploy concrete version of the application from maven repository?\r\nThis can get tricky as Quarkus app is not just one binary by default in JVM mode. For native there is just one artifact, but can be deployed with different modifiers to indicate the target platform. For JVM mode would need to have fat jar or zip archive for simplicity. \r\nAnd of course there could be more different inputs like Bitbucket, GitHub releases, this can get quite complex.\r\n\r\n\r\n@rpelisse, can you look into it? I'm not able to set you as assignee\r\n\r\n@maxandersen / @n1hility any other ideas/priorities around Ansible?\r\n",
