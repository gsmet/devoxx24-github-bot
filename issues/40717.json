  "body": "### Description\n\nWhen using Alternative/Priority, currently `ArcContainerImpl#resolve` will make sure that only the beans with the highest priority number are put into the `Instance`. It would be nice if the lesser priority beans that are not suppressed are able to be injected.\r\n\r\nI also kind of wish that `Instance` could transitively evaluate these things. Like if you have an `Instance<A>` and `A` depends on `B` and `B` has a `LookupIfProperty` that `Instance<A>.isResolvable()` could check B's `LookupIfProperty`. If `B` gets excluded though I'm not sure if the expectation would be for a lower priority B alternative to be found or to just come back and say it's not resolvable. The former kind of gets you to full blown dynamic bean resolution as long as it's on the other side of an `Instance` which I know you all are trying to avoid.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nIf you implemented something for the first suggestion it occurs to me that you could still filter out lower priority beans that come after a bean that doesn't have a Lookup* annotation.",
