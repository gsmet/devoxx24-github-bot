  "body": "### Description\n\nAs of #25367 Quarkus datasource devservices will get reused when Testcontainers has been configured correspondingly (`testcontainers.reuse.enable=true` in `~/.testcontainers.properties`).\r\n\r\nI think it would make sense to also allow other slow-starting devservices to \"participate\" in this. I would thus like to propose that the standard `devservices` config group, which already has a few standard config properties (`enabled`, `image-name`, `port`, `shared`, `service-name`) is extended with a new property for container reuse. Something like `reuse-enabled` with a default of `true`. This \"standard\" config property would of course have to be explicitly added to all extensions providing a devservice, where it conceivably makes sense with container reuse and ultimately this would allow the developer to selectively exclude certain devservices from being reused.\r\n\r\nSome devservices should probably either not declare this config property or possibly even set the default to `false`.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n_No response_",
