  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nVert.x Web Client  is proving to be superior to RestAssured in several areas. \r\nFor example, I've spent a lot of time trying to chase why RestAssured fails to resolve a public Auth0 tenant address, and I still don't know - because I switched to Vert.x Web Client - sometimes it takes a bit of time, but it works most of the time.\r\nThe other area is where we need to test various URI variations as confirmed during the recent work by Michal Vavrik.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\nRestAssured is still a valuable testing tool, so the proposal is to add a Vert.x Web Client section to the REST Client guide explaining which dependency to add, how to create and close it, and how to make typical GET and POST calls",
