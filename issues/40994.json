  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\n`ResteasyReactiveOutputStream` was written so that RESTeasy is able to run on top of Vert.x. \r\nCXF works like RESTeasy: it also writes to a `(Servlet)OutputStream` and to make CXF able to run on top of Vert.x one needs a similar class. For some time, we had an adjusted static copy of  `ResteasyReactiveOutputStream` in Quarkus CXF. At some point, we got issues related to chunking reported, that were fixed in Quarkus long time ago. \r\nAfter that, I implemented a script that adapts `ResteasyReactiveOutputStream.java` at Quarkus CXF runtime which is a bit safer, but still rather fragile. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\nHence, it would be nice if `ResteasyReactiveOutputStream` could be refactored in the following way:\r\n\r\n* Make it independent of RESTeasy\r\n* Possibly move it (along with its ancillary classes) to a separate module in Quarkus that depends only on `vertx-web` but does not depend on RESTeasy\r\n* Or perhaps move the reafctored classes to Vert.x\r\n\r\n@cescoffier encouraged me to prepare a PR which is underway.",
