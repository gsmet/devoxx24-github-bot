  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nI am trying to develop a method that catches a database failure (specifically a constraint violation) and recover from that by returning some other value.\r\nUni.onFailure().recoverWithUni() works in principal (if I just return some value), but if I try to access the database again (reading) within my recovery function, that database read will not succeed but return the error from the previous write, just as if the last error was cached somewhere for that request, even though I performed the write in an explicit transaction.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWithin onFailure().recoverWith() I should be able to read from the database successfully.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nWhen trying to access the database during recovery, a previously raised failure is thrown again.\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\nSee attached maven project to reproduce the case.\r\nNote: Sometimes both test cases fail because the app can't connect to the database (dev service too slow to startup?!), but that's another issue...\r\nNormally, the first test case should succeed and the second will fail (even though it should succeed if recovery worked as expected).\r\nThis happens with Quarkus 2.9.1 but also with 2.8.x\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\nDarwin Kernel Version 21.4.0, arm64 (M1 MacBook Pro, Mac OS Monterey)\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\nJava 17\n\n### GraalVM version (if different from Java)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n2.9.1\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\nmaven 3.8.4\n\n### Additional information\n\n[panache-recovery-error.zip](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/files/8710894/panache-recovery-error.zip)\r\n",
