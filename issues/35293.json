  "body": "I'm using OIDC from Google on my application, which is a web application. Google gives me a valid ID Token, and an opaque Access Token. As per the `KnownOidcProviders` settings for `google`, we set `setVerifyAccessTokenWithUserInfo` to `true`, which means any HTTP call on my web application involves a call to Google.\r\n\r\nIncluding non-authenticated static resources like CSS, images.\r\n\r\nDev UI takes 393 requests (mostly CSS, JS, image files), which means when I'm logged in, I'm making 393 requests to Google. And this takes a while.\r\n\r\nFor absolutely no good reason, because the token is not expired, and we have already verified it, and signed our session cookie.\r\n\r\nIs there really a security reason why we have to verify opaque access tokens when we have already verified them and signed them in a session cookie?\r\n\r\nAlso, is this also the case for other providers? Did we fix the issue where we tried to obtain the `UserInfo` for every request as well?",
