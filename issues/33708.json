  "body": "### Description\n\nhttps://quarkus.io/guides/cli-tooling lists several ways to install the quarkus cli. It doesn't have any top-level docs for how to update the cli, although there's something about updates in each package manager's tab. \r\n\r\nHowever, for a user to be able to follow those instructions, they have to remember what package manager they used the first time. Some users (me!) may forget. It'd be great to be able to call `quarkus update-self` or `quarkus upgrade` or `quarkus refresh` or equivalent. (Naming the self-update of a thing that also updates other things is always tricky, but the principle of self-update is the important part.)\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nAlthough (some) users don't know how they installed the cli, the quarkus cli itself likely knows how it was installed (or it would be easy to give it that knowledge, either by instrumenting the distributed package for each manager, or just looking at its install path).\r\n\r\nIf quarkus knows how it was installed, we could then provide a `quarkus upgrade` that would delegate to the right package manager to do an update.
