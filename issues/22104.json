  "body": "### Description\n\nWe just upgraded from v2.2.3 to v2.5.1 and found a breaking change regarding our REST-resources. In 2.2.3 DI was performed for the dependency-tree for every request. In 2.5.1 DI is only performed the first time a REST-resource is used.\r\n\r\nThe new behaviour is consistent to the documentation https://quarkus.io/guides/rest-json#lifecycle-of-resources, the behaviour in 2.2.3 was not.\r\n\r\nWe consider this a problem, since applications could inject security-relevant beans that might be reused in unexpected contexts when quarkus is upgraded from version 2.2.3.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nThis change should be addressed in the migration guide.",
