  "body": "### Description\n\nI have two proposals for enhancements, with respect to the `@QuarkusTestResource` annotation when combined with the `@QuarkusIntegrationTest`.\r\n\r\n**1. Don't include resources when running `@QuarkusTest` test classes**\r\n\r\nOf course, I don't want integration tests to run in the same phase with the other (unit) tests. However, annotating `@QuarkusIntegrationTest` with the `@QuarkusTestResource`, will still consider this resource to be global and it will started for the tests that are not integration tests. I tried multiple things here, and the only thing that works for me know is to use a profile that disables global resources in all tests that are annotated with `@QuarkusTest`, but this is annoying and error prone for future.\r\n\r\nThe option `restrictToAnnotatedClass` does work, but if I have numerous integration tests having the same resource, the resource would be started and stopped over and over again. This makes CI way longer and is thus unacceptable.\r\n\r\n**2. Disable resource on custom `-Dquarkus.http.test-host` value**\r\n\r\nOnce I want to run my `@QuarkusIntegrationTest`s against a running app, I most likely don't need the resource. I don't see any reason when resource should be started, if I am pointing to the running app.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n_No response_",
