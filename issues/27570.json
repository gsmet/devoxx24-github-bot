  "body": "JAX-RS 3.1.0 introduces some new methods and classes and we will need to implement them in RESTEasy Reactive.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n- get the `jakarta-rewrite` branch from the upstream repository (this branch is already transformed to Jakarta) - it is rewritten daily (but these parts are not moving parts so it shouldn't be a problem)\r\n- `mvn -Dquickly`\r\n- `cd independent-projects/resteasy-reactive`\r\n- change `jakarta.ws.rs-api.version` to `3.1.0` in `pom.xml`\r\n- `mvn clean install`\r\n\r\nFirst failure will be:\r\n\r\n> [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:3.8.1:compile (default-compile) on project resteasy-reactive-common: Compilation failure\r\n> [ERROR] /data/home/gsmet/git/quarkus-jakarta/independent-projects/resteasy-reactive/common/runtime/src/main/java/org/jboss/resteasy/reactive/common/jaxrs/RuntimeDelegateImpl.java:[30,8] org.jboss.resteasy.reactive.common.jaxrs.RuntimeDelegateImpl is not abstract and does not override abstract method createEntityPartBuilder(java.lang.String) in jakarta.ws.rs.ext.RuntimeDelegate\r\n[ERROR]\r\n\r\nOnce this is done, I know there is another one related to the bootstrap and I think that's pretty much it - but I wasn't able to experiment fully.\r\n\r\nNote: the tree won't function fully if you fix that because RESTEasy Classic is pointing to the EE 9 version for now but the idea is to have a compilable RESTEasy Reactive in `independent-projects` so that I can upgrade RESTEasy Classic and JAX-RS in the main bom _(I will handle that part)_.\r\n\r\nI think the easiest way to work on that would be to create a branch in one's fork and push a commit on top of the `jakarta-rewrite` branch. \r\n\r\nThen I would get it and apply it on top of the transformation each night. And we would have an error if the patch doesn't apply cleanly but I don't think these areas change a lot. _(I will handle that part)_\r\n\r\nThese methods/classes have already been implemented in RESTEasy Classic 6.1.0.Final so that could be a source of inspiration.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the `jakarta.ws.rs-api.version` upgrade will be done in a separate first commit as I think I will rely on OpenRewrite to change the version so that everything is centralized.\r\n\r\n/cc @geoand ",
