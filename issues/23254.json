  "body": "### Description\n\nAs discussed on Zulip there is currently already a config property to allow disabling authentication (which is `quarkus.smallrye-jwt.enabled=false` when using the smallrye-jwt extension), but there is no property to disable authorization. There is this [section in the documentation](https://quarkus.io/guides/security-customization#disabling-authorization) which describes how it can be achieved programatically, but that alone would still require a custom config property (or custom extension) to allow disabling authorization for dev-mode only.\r\n\r\nMy use case is that I have web services which use the `@RolesAllowed` annotation to implement authorization. For the dev-mode however, the developer will often want to test an endpoint without having to supply a JWT token. For the authentication part this is already possible, as mentioned, but there will still be a 403 error for endpoints which are annotated with `@RolesAllowed`. For the cases when the business logic in the endpoint doesn't depend on a user name or set of roles, it would thus be nice with a config option to completely disable authorization for dev-mode.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nAs suggested by @sberyozkin on Zulip QuarkusSecurity can register a `DevModeAuthorizationController` only for dev-mode, which will check a known property such as `disable-authorization` as suggested in the docs.",
