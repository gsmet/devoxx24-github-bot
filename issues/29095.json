  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nwhen generating endpoints with quarkus-hibernate-orm-rest-data-panache I have found there is a need to often make pre or post processing changes:\r\n\r\nExample: May want to modify or manually validate data (outside of scope/configs of hibernate validation annotations) before passing it into the endpoint\r\n\r\nExample: May want to further modify the response before sending it for serialization/final response.  Example maybe i want to redact some data from the returned entities.\r\n\r\nis there a way? and if not, it would be nice to have some form of pre and post processing capability.\r\n\r\nInitially it seems like maybe we should support carrying annotations applied on the interface into the generated classes?   But i have seen that in the latest builds of quarkus-hibernate-orm-rest-data-panache, the ability to add Roles were added as ResourceProperties configs.  Why would we do this vs allowing the application of `@RolesAllowed(...)` on the interface methods and carry those methods into the generated classes?  If this type of pattern was used, it seems we could generate `Around` annotations for pre and post processing, similar to how Cache annotations work.  Otherwise would be fine as well with lifecycle hooks in the Resource and method properties configs that allow the application of classes that are called allowing us the ability to modify the data as needed. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\n_No response_",
