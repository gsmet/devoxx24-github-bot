  "body": "### Description\n\nI've been having trouble setting the JVM config options \"Xms\" and \"Xmx\" for my applications that are being packaged as docker container images using Jib. I've read that JVM options like these can be set using \"additional properties\" but I've had no luck,\r\n\r\nI think, particularly for these two options, it would be beneficial to simplify the process of setting these options, or modify the base image Quarkus applications rely on to use more of the available system resources. The reason I believe this is important with containerization is simple. A container's job is to do one thing. The container isolates your application, and runs that application. If there are no other services running on a container, which there should not be, then why restrict the JVM to the standard 1/4 of system RAM? The other ~3/4 of the system RAM (minus what the OS uses) are going to waste. In an environment like Kubernetes, wasted RAM can be very costly.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nI see two potential solutions to this:\r\n\r\n1. A smallrye config option to set heap size manually. This has the benefit of letting the user be explicit about their RAM utilization. The drawback to this approach is that the user could specify a heap size that is unacceptable for their environment.\r\n\r\n2. Modifying the ubi8 image w/ Java to by default allow Java processes to use a larger automatically configured chunk of system RAM (something like 70% maybe?) This has the benefit of automatically scaling to the environment, but has the drawback of potentially starving ultra low resource systems for RAM. The latter should be a rarity. ubi8 uses very little RAM by itself, so a vast majority of systems would be fine with this higher permitted usage.",
