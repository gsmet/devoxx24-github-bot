  "body": "### Description\n\nI have seen this issue discussed in both #26473 and #15891, but it still remains unclear to me how to do the equivalent of `StreamingOutput` with RESTEasy Reactive. If `StreamingOutput` cannot be directly supported as return type for blocking endpoints, I think it would make sense if the documentation provided some clear guidance on how to do this, including how to set headers (e.g. `Content-Disposition` as in the linked discussion), as RESTEasy Reactive is being promoted as the JAX-RS implementation of choice.\r\n\r\nAs in the discussion #26473 we also have a blocking endpoint which returns the output of some third-party library and having to first store that as a temporary file is IMO not very nice.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n_No response_",
