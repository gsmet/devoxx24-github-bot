  "body": "### Description\n\n## Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Background & Rationale\r\nIn the context of local development setups, the current usage of Quarkus Dev Services presents a challenge due to the inability to run Keycloak over HTTPS with a simple TLS certificate. The core of this issue relates to the Microsoft Authentication Library's (MSAL) stringent requirement for HTTPS connections, which is non-negotiable even in local development scenarios, as per the ongoing discussion in their issue tracker ([MSAL Issue #6631](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/issues/6631)).\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\nThe existing issue with MSAL (which may not be resolved due to their security policies) demands that we adapt our local development environment to comply with HTTPS requirements. This requires a way to easily implement TLS for services like Keycloak when using **Quarkus Dev Services**.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Change\r\nIt is imperative to provide an enhancement to **Quarkus Dev Services** that enables the use of a TLS certificate, preferably self-signed for simplicity, for the Keycloak instance. This will bridge the gap between local development practices and the HTTPS enforcement by security libraries such as MSAL.\r\n\r\n### Use Cases\r\n- **Local Development:** Ensuring that local services can be accessed over HTTPS to align with libraries like MSAL that strictly enforce secure connections.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n- The ability to configure a TLS certificate for Keycloak within **Quarkus Dev Services** is provided.\r\n- The configuration process must be simple and streamlined to support rapid and hassle-free local development setups.\r\n\r\nGiven the potential complexities in simplifying this process for local development, I am open to feedback and any collaborative approaches to resolve this issue.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n_No response_",
