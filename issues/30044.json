  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nNote: This is related to #30040 in that both result in `JsonMappingException`s, but this is a different issue.\r\n\r\nI am trying to use `RestMediaType.APPLICATION_STREAM_JSON` to stream a `Multi` that contains a few larger objects (think ~25 kB each) from my reactive java server to a reactive java client, using the rest client.\r\n\r\nHowever, the deserialization of the objects fails with `Unexpected end-of-input` errors, either at the end of `1943` bytes or `8192` bytes. (For the `1943` case,  I think there is potentially header info on the first chunk that is cutting into the `8192` total, since when I try to collect the chunks as Strings instead of reading them as my custom objects, all but the first String are 8192 chars long)\r\n\r\nThrough my own investigation I have found the workaround is to increase the Vertx `HttpClientOptions` for `DEFAULT_MAX_CHUNK_SIZE` and `DEFAULT_RECEIVE_BUFFER_SIZE`, both of which are defaulted to `8192`\r\n\r\nMaybe that is the final solution, but I would think that the rest client should be able to use the newline-delimited json to determine when it has received an entire object, and buffer/hold in memory up to that point before attempting to deserialize. \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nRest client can properly receive and deserialize a stream of larger json objects, without having to fiddle with the http client options myself\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nErrors in the client:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncom.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException: Unexpected end-of-input in field name\r\n at [Source: (ByteArrayInputStream); line: 1, column: 1943]\r\n...\r\ncom.fasterxml.jackson.core.io.JsonEOFException: Unexpected end-of-input in VALUE_STRING\r\n at [Source: (ByteArrayInputStream); line: 1, column: 8192]\r\n```\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\nReproducer: `service3` (client) and `service4` (server) in https://github.com/fleckware/quarkus-test\r\n\r\n1. in one terminal `./gradlew service4:quarkusDev`\r\n2. in a separate terminal `./gradlew service3:quarkusDev`\r\n3. in a separate terminal `curl localhost:8081/service4/test/large > output.json`\r\n4. observe that when hitting the streaming endpoint on the server directly, there is no issue\r\n5. now try to hit it using the rest client `curl localhost:8080/service3/test/large`\r\n6. observe the json mapping error in the `service3` terminal\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\nopenjdk 11.0.10\n\n### GraalVM version (if different from Java)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n2.15.0\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\ngradle 7.4.2\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",
