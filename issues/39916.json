  "body": "At the moment, Quarkus is updated by Dependabot in GitHub repositories which is often counter productive as it misses all the nice changes provided by `quarkus update`.\r\n\r\nWe could imagine that we could have a workflow to create update PRs that would be created by `quarkus update`.\r\nThis could be experimented in a few Quarkiverse extensions before being generalized in the Quarkiverse template.\r\n\r\nWe could even imagine having a GitHub App that would handle this. But that's probably something for later especially since I'm not sure it is easy to run quarkus update on random projects in a secure way. I'm pretty sure you could easily execute anything on the host with a carefully crafted Maven project.",
