  "body": "Turns out [this feature](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/39458) is what broke Renarde CI: https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkiverse/issues/74#issuecomment-2092412856\r\n\r\nIn Renarde, we support various named OIDC providers, and so we support multiple tenants, where each tenant is a known provider, and we have an API that abstracts over them. For some of them we have to use the `UserInfo`, and for others, we don't use it. As such, we inject it every time, we only use it when required.\r\n\r\nThis commit appears to require a user info endpoint at the global level, even though it's not supported or required by every tenant.\r\n\r\nI support my only workaround is to use programmatic injection to bypass this check, but is this really an intended side-effect?\r\n",
