  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\n## General\r\n\r\n* When I created JGit, it somehow was replaced by Jgit (no capital G) in the extension name and several other places. I'm pretty sure I did it right and I think I had the same issue with JSch.\r\n* I think it would probably be nice to have the src/main/(java|resources) src/test/(java|resources) created for both runtime and deployment. From what I saw, some are missing.\r\n\r\n## Runtime\r\n\r\n* Maybe we should have a `<description>Put a description here</description>` in the runtime template? Not worse than having the Quarkiverse parent description appearing IMHO. But I wonder if we should make a description field mandatory when creating an extension. It could then be wired automatically. We need one anyway so why not make it mandatory?\r\n* Maybe we should point to the Quarkiverse doc by default and have a guide entry?\r\n\r\n## Docs\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-neo4j/ is a good example for that\r\n\r\n* docs should have a proper pom.xml, see the template for the new extension I created\r\n  * pom also handles the copy of the potential generated config file to the right place, we probably won't get it right always given it depends on the config root but we could try using the extension name as an approximation\r\n* docs/templates directory should be included\r\n  * the Maven version replaced with what we have in the build)\r\n  * the `:quarkus-neo4j-version:` would probably be better with a :project-version: to be more generic and avoid having to update it\r\n* docs/modules/ROOT/assets/images should be included as it's not easy to figure out how to make images work\r\n* in docs/antora.yml , `title` should be `Quarkus Extension` and not `Quarkus - Extension` (no dash). The idea is that we don't want to convey the idea it's part of Quarkus (also it messes up the order in Antora)\r\n* docs/modules/ROOT/pages/config.adoc containing Freemarker config  should go away\r\n* index.adoc should be updated to:\r\n  * use the attributes.adoc we generate (see Neo4j for example)\r\n  * use the generated config include file we generate (and copy with the pom) - maybe with an optional by default so that user can build things \r\n\r\n## CI\r\n\r\n* Release workflow should be updated to take into account the updated file (see neo4j one for instance) - the block Maven Release needs the additional commit and the new block to adjust the tag needs to be in\r\n* Quarkus snapshot workflow should be updated to point to `quarkiverse-extension` not `quarkus-extension` as the ecosystem path\r\n* Add -Dnative in .github/workflows/build.yml - at least I did it for all the moved extensions as I wanted them to be covered\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\n_No response_",
