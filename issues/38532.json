  "body": "### Description\n\nDev services containers follow the lifecycle of quarkus dev.\r\nIf quarkus dev starts, containers will start. When quarkus dev stops, containers will stop as well.\r\nAs long as we are using quarkus dev, without restarting it, it is fine, but there are a number of situations where a complete restart is required. In those situations, the time needed to recreate the dev services containers may impact the developer productivity.\r\nAnother situation is when running manually a single test that requires a dev services containers. The test may run for a few seconds, but the entire infrastructure needed to run the test might be several tenths of seconds, impacting the developer productivity.\r\nThis feature requests is about trying to save some time when restarting dev mode, or running tests, by not having to restart dev services containers.\r\nA discussion as taken place in [zulip](https://quarkusio.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/187030-users/topic/dev.20services.20start.20time.20.3D.3E.20docker.20compose.3F)\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n_No response_",
