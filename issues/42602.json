  "body": "### Description\n\nToday quarkus capture the application version and makes it available at runtime via `quarkus.application.version`\r\n\r\nIt would be pretty handy to make metadata about the build available in the application code via config properties (for example the build id provided by the CI, the commit sha or the build date).\r\n\r\nToday, the only solution I can think of to achieve this is to use a maven plugin to write this data in a file that is included in the jar as a resources.\r\n\r\nContext: \r\n\r\nWe are building an extension for temporal https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-temporal\r\nTemporal enable durable execution, In order for a workflow that started with a given version to complete with the same version, there is a feature called worker versioning relying on the build id:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.temporal.io/develop/java/versioning#worker-versioning\r\n\r\nI am creating this issue to explore whether this process could be standardized.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n_No response_",
