  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nI realize this is sort of a nitpick, but is it possible to reorder the components of the documentation pages' titles?\r\n\r\nCurrently, it is something along the lines of:\r\n\r\n`Quarkus - <page content title>`\r\n\r\nWhereas the following would be better (I think):\r\n\r\n`<page content title> - Quarkus`\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reasoning here is that when you have a bunch of tabs open, and can only see the first few characters of a particular tab's title, then you can't tell one page from another as all you can see is `Quark`. Bootstrap, for example, uses this approach and it is much easier to navigate to the documentation page based on looking at the tabs.\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\nI am hoping that it would be a simple change, where just the template used for all the pages would need to be tweaked slightly.",
