  "body": "### Description\n\nSee https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/21110#issuecomment-1120961408\r\n\r\n> But currently the Hibernate Reactive extension for Quarkus is in a problematic shape: it's highly coupled to the core of the Hibernate ORM blocking extension, and the presence of it actually taints the state of the blocking ORM instances. It needs to be rewritten with a more flexible design.\r\n\r\nEssentially the Hibernate Reactive extension is relying on the Hibernate ORM extension, reusing parts of it but not others. It's imperfect, so sometimes it reuses things that make no sense for Hibernate Reactive (only for ORM), and sometimes it fails to reuse things that *would* make sense for both ORM and Hibernate Reactive (e.g. #28576).\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nWe will probably want a common base for both Hibernate ORM and Reactive, and two separate extensions for Hibernate ORM and Reactive. We'll use SPIs to have each extension customize the base where necessary.\r\n\r\nThis will most likely be a large change, so it will have to wait until @Sanne is done with the Hibernate ORM 6 upgrade; else we'll have many conflicts.",
