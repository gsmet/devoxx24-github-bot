  "body": "### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nMy changes to Qute templates now get reloaded automatically without browser requests, so, if I type a mistake in my Qute template and save, I get an error in the DEV console, but then, if I fix it and save, nothing happens, because hot reload becomes disabled after the first error.\r\n\r\nThis is very confusing behaviour, because for people working from their IDE with `quarkus:dev` open in a terminal in the IDE, they get used to the console confirming that they did not write any mistakes every time they save, and then, once they make a mistake, the hot reload appears broken, to them. It's not broken, it's disabled. But that means they need to restart the quarkus app, or go to a browser, which they didn't need to do when it moved from \"working\" to \"not working\".\r\n\r\nI've observed that it's very confusing UX. This is also the opposite of what continuous testing does.\r\n\r\nI really thing we should fix that.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nFixing an error in a Qute template and saving, should hot reload that file and get rid of errors in the console.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nFixing an error in a Qute template and saving has no effect on the dev console, making it look broken.\r\n \r\n### How to Reproduce?\r\n\r\n- Save a Qute template with no error\r\n- - It gets hot reloaded\r\n- Add an error and save the template\r\n- - The console turns red\r\n- Fix the error and save the template\r\n- - Nothing happens",
