  "body": "### Description\n\nBefore I switched to Quarkus, I used Spring and Spring has a feature which I really miss in Quarkus. Dont get me wrong I love working with Quarkus.\r\n\r\nBut Spring has the @DirtiesContext annotation and its very valuable in integration tests. I know that Quarkus has @TestTransaction but this seems not to work all the time. It worked fine until we integrated our database which also uses transactions and at this point @TestTransaction stopped working. In Spring this was never a problem but in Quarkus we have now the problem that our integration tests somehow depend on each other because @TestTransaction does not reset the context correctly. \r\n\r\nHopefully I explained the problem well, so maybe we could implement @DirtiesContext for Quarkus which restarts the context and restarts all dev-services.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nIdeally we would implement a @DirtiesContext annotation which restarts the context, kills all active threads - so every thread which was started gets killed and does not effect the next test - and restarts all containers which were started by dev-services or Testcontainers.
