It happens to be a Camel application which one of the routes looks like:\r\n\r\n       ...\r\n       fromF(\"file://%s?include=.*.xml&delete=true&idempotent=true&bridgeErrorHandler=true\", inBox)\r\n         .doTry()\r\n           .to(\"validator:xsd/money-transfers.xsd\")\r\n       ...\r\nThis route is polling an input folder and, as soon as an XML file lands in it, it tries to validate it against the schema named `money-transfers.xsd`, found in the `xsd` directory. This directory is located in `src/main/resources` folder of the maven project and, after the build, it lands at the root of the resulting JAR.\r\n\r\nThis works as expected in JVM mode but, trying to run it in native mode raises the following exception:\r\n\r\n    2023-06-02 14:18:48,788 ERROR [org.apa.cam.imp.eng.AbstractCamelContext] (main) Error starting CamelContext (camel-1) due to exception thrown: Failed to start route route1 because of null: org.apache.camel.FailedToStartRouteException: Failed to start route route1 because of null\r\n    ...\r\n    Caused by: org.apache.camel.RuntimeCamelException: java.io.FileNotFoundException: Cannot find resource: xsd/money-transfer.xsd for URI: xsd/money-transfer.xsd\r\n        at  org.apache.camel.component.validator.DefaultLSResourceResolver$DefaultLSInput.getByteStream(DefaultLSResourceResolver.java:139)\r\n\r\nIn the JAR associated to the native image I have:\r\n\r\n    $ jar tvf target/aws-camelk-file-native-image-source-jar/aws-camelk-file-runner.jar\r\n      ...\r\n          0 Fri Jun 02 14:16:44 CEST 2023 xsd/\r\n          890 Fri Jun 02 14:16:44 CEST 2023 xsd/money-transfers.xsd\r\n         2118 Fri Jun 02 14:16:44 CEST 2023 xsd/money-transfer.xsd\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nIs there any reason not to be able to locate the mentioned file ?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nNicolas\r\n\r\n</div>",
