  "body": "### Description\n\nI recently discovered that I can perform read operations using a Panache repository during a QuarkusTest without an active transaction. This behavior took me by surprise, and it also resulted in incorrect data being returned (possibly due to caching.  Unfortunately, I couldn't reproduce the issue with a reproducer). As soon as I put an active transaction around the test, everything works as expected. I attempted to find a configuration option to enforce a transaction for read operations, but I was unable to locate a suitable setting.\r\n\r\nIt seems that setting the TransactionRequirement to STRICT is not a viable solution for me, as it would prevent the Liquibase migration from executing.\r\n\r\nWithout putting into question that no transaction is required to read, I would like to propose a new configuration property to be able to enforce transactions even for read operation. This way, everyone can use transactions according to their preferences.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n_No response_",
