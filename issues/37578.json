When analyzing the problem and performing profiling in the construction phase, we identified that a build stage was analyzing the project's beans to assemble the data for the quarkus devui page.\r\n\r\nClass: io.quarkus.arc.deployment.devconsole.ArcDevConsoleProcessor.java\r\nQuarkus version: 2.16.9-Final\r\n\r\nThe addNodesDependencies function of the ArcDevConsoleProcessor class was the one that spent the longest time running when starting the application (around 70% of the time consuming CPU)\r\n\r\nWe understand that the best way would be to break this project into several others. However, due to the urgency, we need to keep everything in one project only due to the high refactoring time.\r\n\r\nMy question is how can I disable this functionality to save build time in development mode in my project?</div>",
