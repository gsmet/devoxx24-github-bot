  "body": "### Description\n\nRun Wiremock (https://wiremock.org/) together with your Quarkus application in development mode.\r\nSeparated from your application code and only build when a property is set. \r\n\r\nWhile Wiremock can be easily started in a separate process, it is nice to have it together in one project with one startup command.\r\n \r\nInterested in this extension, please +1 via the emoji/reaction feature of GitHub (top right).\n\n### Configuration suggestion\n\nquarkus.wiremock.dev.enabled=true\r\nquarkus.wiremock.dev.path=src/main/resources\n\n### Additional context\n\nCurrently within our team we use Wiremock for our integration tests. During development we also run a standalone Wiremock process where we can develop against. It would be nicer to run Wiremock embedded when development mode is active. The  lifecycle will be synced and you would only have to run quarkus:dev to get everything you need. \r\n\r\nWhile we need Wiremock in development we do not want this to be active in prod. \r\n\r\nI already did a POC where I could successfully point to a folder with all the Wiremock mappings.\r\n[wiremock-dev.zip](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/files/9229544/wiremock-dev.zip)\r\n\r\nIf there is interest I can iterate further on this. \r\n ",
