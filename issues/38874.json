  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nHello there,\r\n\r\nI came across BlockingNotAllowedException being thrown while using the Reactive Keycloak Admin Client \"quarkus-keycloak-admin-client-reactive\". Since the name \"reactive\" is there, I would assume that it runs smoothly with other reactive components and through Uni calls. But somehow, the BlockingNotAllowedException is thrown. I also have discovered some other weird issues as well.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the problem, I have created a small repo to tryout: [https://github.com/maxlam79/quarkus-propagation-tryout](https://github.com/maxlam79/quarkus-propagation-tryout). All the dependencies are \"reactive\" at best.\r\n\r\nNote: please take note that the DB settings are to point to the DB dev services which runs fine. But the keycloak settings are pointed to a an external demo keycloak server. The settings are right and tested (I have to do this because it was very painful for me to get the keycloak dev services up and running).\r\n\r\nTest results:\r\nGET - http://localhost:8080/resource/p02\r\nThis end point only calls the Keycloak Admin Client and retrieves the total number of users. Calling this end point fails, throwning BlockingNotAllowedException without ```@Blocking``` annotation. But it runs fine with ```@Blocking```. My expectation is that it shoudln't throw a BlockingNotAllowedException since all calls are through Uni.\r\n\r\nPOST - http://localhost:8080/resource/p03\r\nThis end point creates some entries to the DB, runs fine. Generally, I use Panache.withTransaction when persistence to DB is involved.\r\n\r\nPOST - http://localhost:8080/resource/p04\r\nThis is where things gets really interesting. This end point make calls to Keycloak Admin Client and create entries to the DB. All are executed within Panache.withTransaction.\r\n\r\nWithout ```@Blocking``` - throws BlockingNotAllowedException\r\nWith ```@Blocking``` - it throws error id: c0270815-eeff-465e-9084-63f54c80dd60-2: java.lang.IllegalStateException: HR000068: This method should exclusively be invoked from a Vert.x EventLoop thread; currently running on thread 'executor-thread-1'\r\n\r\nAppreciate if someone could look into this. Thank you.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\nMacOS Montery 12.7.2\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\nopenjdk version \"21\" 2023-09-19\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n3.7.3\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\napache-maven-3.9.4\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",
