  "body": "### Description\n\nCurrently it is very hard if not impossible to enrich log messages related to a request or message with additional context information (e.g. a \"correlation-id\"). For SREs / operations it is very important to be able to correlate log messages and filter the messages in a log management tool for faster issue analysis. This is often achieved by passing some context attributes  along the processing chain that will appear in all logs of related tasks of all involved systems.\r\nJBoss-Logging and slf4j provide an MDC object that allows to set context information that is available in the logger and can be included in the log-format. Since the MDC internally uses a `ThreadLocal` object to associate the context information, this information is lost, if the thread is switched (e.g. due to a blocking execution from a `vert.x-eventloop-thread` to an `executor-thread`).\r\nThe goal of this ticket is to either make MDC work or offer an alternative solution to be able to include context information in the related log messages - which means passing context information along  the execution chain.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nSee also https://quarkusio.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/187030-users/topic/Contextual.20Logging.20in.20Quarkus",
