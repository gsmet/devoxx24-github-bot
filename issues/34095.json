  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nJust Recently, i've upgraded the bunch of services to Quarkus 3.1.1.Final. \r\nIt works perfectly itself. But after including minio i realized that we can use minio-client versions only lower than 8.2.3, because versions upper do not work due to okhttp < 4.8.1 which stricted by quarkus-bom. \r\nAfter some researching i ve noticed this\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/29520\r\nand this\r\nhttps://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-minio/issues/220\r\n\r\nand this\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/30798\r\n\r\n\r\nand even that \r\nhttps://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/30396\r\n\r\nand this https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-minio/issues/144 \r\nwhich references to this https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/30480\r\n\r\nbut after reading all that i can not understand what is going on now. are we removing dependency ?  why it still here ?\r\n\r\nMaybe we can use this Issue to aggregate status about OkHttp ?\r\n\r\nP.S. And maybe we can ask maintainers of minio-java to implement posibility of using not just okhttp, but any other http clients such as vert.x ? (or  as example i will try PR with such kind implementation to minio-java by myself, but its just suggestion)",
