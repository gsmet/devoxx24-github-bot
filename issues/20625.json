  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently 18 guides are shown as square boxes in the `Security` category at https://quarkus.io/guides/. To those who are new to Quarkus it can be overwhelming and possibly confusing. \r\n\r\nIf users were able to switch to a `Hierarchical View` then for some  users it would be of help, for example, they'd see \r\n`Core`/`Security`/`Web` etc, click on `Security` and see `Security Overview`/`OpenId Connect`/`Basic Authentication`/`Vault`/etc - so here they can easily move to the exact guide which they need.\r\n\r\nThey can `search` right now but it offers a different level of guidance - if the users are not quite sure what they are looking for then the only option is to scroll through the rather long guides page.\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\nIt can probably be quite hard to make right, but just as an initial step, what would be not bad if a user could just click on `Switch to Hierarchical View` and then see the current list of categories (`Core`, `Data`, etc) in a hierarchical menu and clicking for ex on `Data` or `Security` would list the current `Data` or `Security` guides the same way they are shown now, so the only difference is that the users would not `search` but simply follow the menu.\r\n\r\nAt some later stage clicking on the top level Hierarchical menu item would lead to another menu (ex, `Security`->`OpenId Connect` -> and now only show OIDC guides, etc)\r\n\r\nCC @Ladicek ",
