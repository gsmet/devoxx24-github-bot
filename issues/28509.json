  "body": "### Description\n\nOur request is best explained by example. Here is our openapi definition in swagger as served by Quarkus:\r\n\r\nhttps://eclipse-java-sandbox.ukheshe.rocks/eclipse-conductor/docs/#/\r\n\r\nAnd the same openapi in readme.com (A very popular developer portal software)\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.ukheshe.com/reference/\r\n\r\nOur problem is that readme orders the API tags in the order they find them under the paths section (a,z,b etc), while swagger orders them in the order they are found in the tags section (a,b,c etc). \r\n\r\nI believe swagger is correct and the defacto, but readme refuse to align with what swagger does, and hence our API docs tags are all out of order. We have given up asking readme and have come to ask if Quarkus/Smallrye can make a change (possibly configurable) to allow all readme.com users to order their API's the same way as Swagger.\r\n\r\nThe request is that the openapi json should not only have the tags section in alphabetical order, but then also order the paths in the order of their tags. \r\n\r\n\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nLoop through the tags in alphabetical order and add each path that falls under that tag. Then finally add all paths that have no tag. This way as readme loops through the paths it will populate its list of tags in alphabetical order.",
