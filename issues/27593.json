  "body": "This is a preexisting issue: the test classpath is polluted by the Bootstrap dependencies, especially those coming from the Maven stuff.\r\n\r\nIt is even more annoying with the Jakarta migration as we will have a javax.inject dependency coming with Maven (we cannot get rid of it, unfortunately), which means that we will have several `@Inject` annotations around.\r\n\r\n@aloubyansky is going to experiment with a possible solution to this issue.",
