  "body": "### Description\n\nDear Quarkus team,\r\n\r\nI propose adding an extension to the Quarkus framework for interacting with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Step Functions.\r\n\r\nAWS Step Functions is a fully managed service that enables developers to build, test, and run workflows that execute as a series of steps. These workflows can be triggered by a variety of events, such as an HTTP request, a scheduled time, or the completion of a downstream task. Step Functions make it easy to coordinate and execute complex, long-running processes asynchronously, which can be particularly useful in microservices architectures.\r\n\r\nAdding an extension for AWS Step Functions to Quarkus would enable developers to easily incorporate Step Functions into their applications, making it possible to build, deploy, and run workflows that coordinate the execution of microservices and other components.\r\n\r\nThe extension would be called something like `io.quarkiverse.amazonservices:quarkus-amazon-stepfunctions`\r\n\r\nI believe that this extension would be a valuable addition to the Quarkus framework, as it would allow developers to take advantage of the benefits of Step Functions when building cloud-native applications.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this proposal.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nCÃ©sar Aguilera\r\n\r\nif you are interested in this extension, please +1 via the emoji/reaction feature of GitHub (top right).\n\n### Repository name\n\nquarkus-amazon-stepfunctions\n\n### Short description\n\nQuarkus support for AWS stepfunctions \n\n### Repository Homepage URL\n\n_No response_\n\n### Repository Topics\n\n- quarkus \r\n- aws \r\n- stepfunctions \r\n- microservices \r\n- cloudnative \r\n- workflow \r\n- coordination \r\n- async \r\n- extension proposal\n\n### Team Members\n\n- \r\n\n\n### GitHub Applications?\n\n- [ ] [Stale](https://github.com/marketplace/stale) - Automatically close stale Issues and Pull Requests that tend to accumulate during a project\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
