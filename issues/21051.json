  "body": "### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nAs I added a distroless setup to AWT graphics Quickstart: https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts/pull/961  (depends on #20850), it struck me as odd that all quickstarts, including those potentially sensitive to native libs such as Tika, use `quay.io/quarkus/quarkus-distroless-image:1.0` ([yaml](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-images/blob/main/quarkus-distroless-image.yaml)) as their base, which is in fact Debian based.\r\n\r\nQuarkus native executable is thus built using UBI 8 based builder image and then copied into Debian userland, with Debian libz copied over, hoping for the best, see ([yaml](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-images/blob/main/quarkus-distroless-image.yaml#L16)).\r\n\r\nI used [ubi-micro](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introduction-ubi-micro) for the AWT quickstart distroless, manually copying necessary libraries from `ubi-minimal`, which is somewhat frail, although better off than if I attempted to use Debian libs to satisfy UBI dependencies....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI find such setup fragile. It seems to me that if we aim for truly minimalistic setup, we should be working with [ubi-micro](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introduction-ubi-micro).\r\n\r\n",
