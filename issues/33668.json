  "body": "### Description\n\nThe CDI specification demands that if a bean isn't injected anywhere, unproxyability shouldn't be a deployment problem, but an exception at runtime. This is a confusing special case, as detailed in https://github.com/jakartaee/cdi/issues/673. We implemented this behavior in #33523 for specification compatibility, but only in the ArC strict mode, because the default ArC behavior makes more sense for build-time oriented implementations and is generally more useful and easier to understand.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nIf we can change the specification to allow (or even demand?) ArC's default behavior, we should be able to revert the commit that implements the behavior prescribed by CDI 4.0.",
