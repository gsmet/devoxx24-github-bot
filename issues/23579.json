  "body": "### Description\n\nSome OIDC properties which enable stricter security are not activated by default, for example, `quarkus.oidc.authentication.pkce-required` (as noticed by @pedroigor), to be introduced `nonce` might not be for `web-app` applications. This is compensated by the fact the if the client secret is set then the code would still be well-protected, but there extra safety measures will never hurt.\r\n\r\nAlso, `forceRedirectHttpsScheme` (i.e, we really don't want `HTTP` only endpoints  doing the code flow, so if enforcing it if `http` is only a proxy thing would not be a problem, also suggested for the `apple` profile by @FroMage), expected token type is optional (if we can deduce it is Keycloak we can enforce the type, id/access/refresh), etc.\r\n\r\nBy introducing a `strict` profile we can enforce that these and other relevant properties are enabled/enforced. This profile can be also activated by default and the users would then override some specific properties.\r\n\r\nThis idea of a strict profile can be relevant not only to `oidc` but other security extensions. For ex, requiring the authentication by default, etc\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nProbably introduce `quarkus.security.strict=true` and then start from `oidc` and then keep going and check other security extensions (in follow up issues)",
