  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nwe are using Emitters for sending message to remote MQ broker.\r\nNormally without  any OnOverflow annotation\r\n`  @Inject\r\n    @Channel(RESPONSE_QUEUE)\r\n    Emitter<String> emitter;\r\n    ...\r\n     public void emit(Message<String> toEmit) {\r\n           this.emitter.send(toEmit);\r\n   ...\r\n`\r\nFew times we observed situation that if remote broker was restarted, emiting of messages stopped working.\r\nFor few x (~100) messages we didnt get any errror (i guess x= default size of buffer),\r\nthen we started to get errror\r\n`\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: SRMSG00034: Insufficient downstream requests to emit item\r\n`\r\nThis was only solved by quarkus app restart.\r\nHealth report for channel was all time showing OK status.\r\n\r\nWe are also using a lot of consumers  (`@Incoming` ) of amqp messages, this were susccessfully reconnected and continue to work.\r\n\r\nWhn i try to use for example\r\n`\r\n@OnOverflow(FAIL, bufferSize = 100)\r\n`\r\nit at least discnnected after error from channel and started reporting KO in health check, but here bufferSize seems to be ignored, so it is not usable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nEmitting channel must be resilient against remote broker restart and must continue to emit messages.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nSometimes restarts of remote broker was handled ok, but noit always.\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n1. must have installed amq broker (in our case Redhat AMQ7.11)\r\n2. quarkus app with Emitter to some queue in remote broker\r\n3. emit messages in some intervlas and restart broker.\r\n4. for me always ~6 restart of broker was enough to simulate this issue, that aftger one of this restarts no new message ws emitted.\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n17\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n2.16.12.Final\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",
