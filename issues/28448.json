  "body": "### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nReservation: I'm not sure if this's a bug or a work limitation of the annotation @QuarkusTest. This is our first big project on this framework, so please don't judge strictly.\r\n\r\nMy team and I write a project on Kotlin, using Quarkus as the main framework, and Gradle as the main build system. We have an application that we are currently covering with tests. The problem arises when we write REST-http tests to our EndPoints. The tests work out correctly, but only when we run them, with the application running. But if we turn off the application and put the @QuakusTest annotation, which, according to the documentation, should run the application itself before running the tests, an exception occurs:\r\n\r\n\"Connection refused: no further information\r\njava.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: no further information\"\r\n\r\nPlease answer - did we understand correctly that @QuakusTest annotation allows to run tests without running the main application, and if not - is there any other way to run tests without running the application and preferably on some kind of abstract database so that the test call and its operation do not affect the main DB.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAutomatic launch of the application before the tests themselves start working when they are called. The actions performed by the tests occur with a virtual, not a real database.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe tests work correctly when the application is turned on manually. But when the application is turned off, when trying to launch, they start to fall with an exception:\r\n\r\n\"Connection refused: no further information\r\njava.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: no further information\"\r\n\r\n### How to Reproduce?\r\n\r\nA link to our small test project on github, on which we tested the work of a real project: \r\nhttps://github.com/Bazalii/Interactive-map\r\n\r\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Output of `java -version`\r\n\r\nJava 17, Kotlin 1.6.21\r\n\r\n### GraalVM version (if different from Java)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Quarkus version or git rev\r\n\r\n2.11.1.Final\r\n\r\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\r\n\r\nGradle 7.4.2\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nWe searched Internet for information about this problem, but the only thing we found was a bit similar question on StackOverflow, where the solution was - to connect \"io.quarkus:quarkus-resteasy-reactive-jackson\". We tried this option, but it didn't help(\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70962483/194545657-8593fdcf-e3aa-41c8-ba26-3718c9c74ce5.png)\r\n\r\n",
