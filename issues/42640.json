  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nInterested in this extension, please +1 via the emoji/reaction feature of GitHub (top right).\r\n\r\nHey there! Recently, I have found myself deciding on what to use for my projects for authorization. Quarkus has a basic extensions, like elytron security extension that gives you free rein, but this can get quite tedious after some time. On the flip side, there are full-blown auth services like Clerk or Supabase, or auth apps like Keycloak. My apps are mostly on the smaller side, so I'm not keen on adding another service or creating dependencies.  And since I couldn't find an extension that would fit my needs, I built my own. It handles basic credentials or OAuth with some basic providers (Discord, Github, Google, with more coming in the future), and if you're authorized, you get access and refresh tokens. Down the line, I'm thinking of adding organizations, API keys, webhooks, and maybe some other handy features.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the repository consists of the following extensions:\r\n\r\n- core: This extension contains basic models, repository interfaces, and logic for user authentication.\r\n- jdbc-panache: This extension implements the repositories and adds entities for use with JDBC. (This is for future extensibility, so that there can be, for example, a mongo-panache extension, etc.)\r\n- external-authentication: This provides clients and classes for external OAuth authentication. Currently implements GitHub, Google, and Discord. \r\n\r\n### Repository name\r\n\r\nquarkus-zenei\r\n\r\n### Short description\r\n\r\nQuarkus extensions for user authentication and authorization.\r\n\r\n### Repository Homepage URL\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Cloudeko/cloudeko-zenei/tree/master/extensions\r\n\r\n### Repository Topics\r\n\r\n- quarkus-extension\r\n- authorization\r\n- security\r\n- tokens\r\n\r\n\r\n### Team Members\r\n\r\n- @zZHorizonZz\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThe extension is currently under heavy development as I initially made an app, but now I'm moving most of the functionality to the extensions.\r\n\r\nAlso, this extension currently uses MapStruct and Lombok, which I didn't find any information on the Quarkus team's posture on these depedencies. I don't mind removing dependency on these if necessary.",
