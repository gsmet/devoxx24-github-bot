  "body": "### Description\n\nI wrote a `QuarkusUnitTest` and placed it in a module that is not a deployment module, and the errors I got were puzzling to me:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCouldn't make the test class LoginControllerTest an unremovable bean (probably because a dependency on io.quarkus:quarkus-arc-deployment is missing); other beans may also be removed and injection may not work as expected\r\nâ€¦ lots of things that seemed normal\r\nCould not find LoginControllerTest bean\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe documentation at https://quarkus.io/guides/writing-extensions mention `These tests should be placed in the deployment module` but really it should be `MUST`. If an error was thrown that detected it was not in a deployment module and told me that it had to be in a deployment module I would have saved a lot of time. This can be helpful to other users.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n_No response_",
