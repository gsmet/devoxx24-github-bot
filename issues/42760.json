  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nAs part of #29888 (cc: @sberyozkin, @michalvavrik, @Doctor-love) a check was added for the address of the proxy which the proxy uses to connect to Quarkus.\r\n\r\nI see that the PR goes beyond the original request to add also a proxy port number which is IMHO hard or even impossible to get working and should probably be removed. As we're now exposing this option to the users o Keycloak, I'm having a hard time to explain it to our users and to see where this can be used successfully. \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nA trusted proxy configuration with and without a port should work as expected.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nIf you specify a trusted proxy with a port, IMHO only a single connection can be established at any given time:\r\n\r\nA TCP connection is identified by the the four elements source IP, source port, target port and target IP. The target port and target IP are where Quarkus listens for incoming connections and are thereby fixed. Source host is the proxy. If I also limit the source port, the proxy can only establish a single connection at a time. And even if that connection is closed, it might take a while until it can open a new connection while it is still in CLOSE_WAIT state AFAIK.\r\n\r\n\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n_No response_\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\nhttps://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/32346#discussion_r1731299359",
