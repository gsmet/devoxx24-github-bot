  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nThe Narayana project has the capability to store the transaction logs into a JDBC Datasource; this should be our recommendation for users needing transaction recovery capabilities, especially when running in volatile containers.\r\n\r\nWe currently don't seemt to expose the configuration properties to enable this component and bind it to a Datasource managed by Quarkus; also Narayana is only exposing an API which accepts a JDBC URL while we would highly prefer to inject the Datasource by instance. Allowing the `Datasource` to be injected is most likely trivial but will need to be patched at the Narayana side first: we don't want to start additional connections which could bypass the connection pool limits and risk resource starvation.\r\n\r\nSecondarily, schema creation control would need to be configurable. Currently Narayana will always check for the existence of the expected tables and attempt to create them when missing; it would be preferrable to expose some more flexibility, such as to log/generate the SQL scripts to create them instead, to allow controlling such aspects with schema evolution tools and/or potentially with different user credentials than the ones used at runtime.\r\n",
