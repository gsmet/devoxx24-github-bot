  "body": "### Description\n\nIn the current version (2.7.2.Final) POJO which can be deduced from @ConsumeEvent endpoints are automatically registered, it's really good, but if we want to implement a simple routing solution which makes use of the Object type as a return type for the endpoint then we have to manually register the POJO in order to use them with the event bus.\r\n\r\nIf we could have an annotation such as :\r\n\r\n@RegisterForEventBus or something like that, it would enable us to write cleaner code\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nI don't know how the codec are automatically implemented but I suppose we could just pick up those POJO using an annotation and implement the codecs at the same time we implement the codec deduced from the endpoints",
