  "body": "### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nThe decoding of a JPEG compressed image within TIFF container used to throw an `Unsupported Image Type` exception.\r\nThe image was valid, not produced by a ImageMagic+Radamsa fuzzer, but a manually crafted in GIMP.\r\n\r\nIt seems that [JDK-8274735](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8274735) fixes that and `test_jpeg.tiff` can be decoded now and that makes the test suite fail as it still expects the exception.\r\n\r\nWith that said, the decoded image still doesn't look right, so there is probably something still wrong in the JDK implementation.\r\n\r\nI will fix the TS so as it takes into account older/newer JDKs.\r\n\r\nOur goal here is to execute code paths in decoders so as we trigger those in Native image. We are not that much concerned with testing how JDK itself processes images. With that said, it might be worth reporting to the JDK mailing list anyway.\r\n\r\nWIP....\r\n",
