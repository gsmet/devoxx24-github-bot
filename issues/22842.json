  "body": "Okay, I have come across this issue before but never figured out how to replicate it (until now).\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to be that when a maven quarkus build runs, and pulls down `org.yaml:snakeyaml:1.29`, it is lacking something that the Gradle project needs. This poisons the `.m2` cache, causing the following error in the Gradle project:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCould not find snakeyaml-1.29-android.jar (org.yaml:snakeyaml:1.29).\r\nSearched in the following locations:\r\n    file:/home/gstewart/.m2/repository/org/yaml/snakeyaml/1.29/snakeyaml-1.29-android.jar\r\n\r\nPossible solution:\r\n - Declare repository providing the artifact, see the documentation at https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_repositories.html\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimply nuking the snakyaml directory in `.m2` fixes it for the Gradle project, where it goes and gets its own copy, but the issue returns as soon as one runs the Maven Quarkus project, and the dependency is brought into `.m2` again.\r\n\r\nI am assuming it's either something slightly off in config between maven and gradle iterations, and hopefully not something out of our control. I don't explicitly pull in the snakeyaml in either project, but do use the yaml properties plugin in my Gradle project.\r\n",
