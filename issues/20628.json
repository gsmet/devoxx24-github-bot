  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nIn some cases it would be great if it were possible to type the shell commands while also working with Dev UI.\r\n\r\nFor example, with [Dev Services for Kerberos](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-kerberos/blob/main/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc#dev-services-for-kerberos), here is what the docs recommend:\r\n1. do `mvn quarkus:dev` - Kerberos container has started\r\n2. and now a not very cool step - set `KRB5_CONFIG` to point to a generated KRB5 config file, type `kinit` and then `curl --negotiate`\r\n\r\nHowever, if instead of 2, a user were able to go to DevUI and just type a user name and password then it would be great - in fact, since some default users are created it is already possible to add such Dev UI - but it is not possible to administer KDC beyond registering a few simple users/realm at the container startup.\r\n\r\nSo while in Dev UI, if I could, somewhere alongside the logging console, just type `kadmin addprinc` with whatever realm and password or keytab then `kinit` etc, and then in Dev UI type the user name/password and a handler would take care of negotiating with Quarkus, etc, then it would be nice. The container sets a system property pointing to this generated KDC file, so such shell commands running as part of the Quarkus Dev mode/UI process would pick it up.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\n_No response_",
