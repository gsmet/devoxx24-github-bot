  "body": "When playing with an app that is ignored by build analytics for the first time, typically playing with a quickstart, we are asking the user if they want to enable build analytics. \r\n\r\nIf they say yes, we display a message saying build analytics will be ignored. \r\n\r\nSo first I thing we shouldn’t ask the user about build analytics when they’re playing with an ignored project: we don’t want to bother a user exploring Quarkus for the first time with this. Especially when we are not actually collecting data. \r\n\r\nSecondly, I think we shouldn’t log anything when build analytics is ignored for a project. The user really doesn’t care about it. And when I say that, I mean in all cases: even if he has enabled build analytics, telling the user this particular project won’t send any build time analytics has very little value and can be confusing. \r\n\r\n/cc @brunobat @maxandersen ",
