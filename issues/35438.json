  "body": "We have been hit by a timeout issue in Dependabot for a while and our project is not updated as timely as it should be, which could become problematic.\r\nOnly part of the tree is analyzed in each Dependabot run, and while I was told that the modules are randomly examined so we should eventually get to all the modules being analyzed, I'm not exactly happy with the behavior we have for several months now.\r\n\r\nI was always a bit worried about moving to another tool as most of these tools require read/write access to your Git repository, meaning you give the keys to your repository to an external entity, which will be able to push anything to your tree.\r\n\r\nHowever, @maxandersen pointed me that there is a \"forking\" version of Renovate, which actually create PRs from a fork and thus only need a read access to your repository: https://github.com/apps/forking-renovate .\r\n\r\nNote that I have no idea if it would perform better than our current Dependabot setup but I think it's probably worth trying.\r\n\r\nWe need to check that:\r\n- this thing actually works as expected\r\n- we can translate our configuration to Renovate\r\n- it scales better than Dependabot\r\n\r\nThis experiment should be done on a temporary clone of Quarkus (and I would recommend for it to not being a fork) so that we can actually see how it scales without being problematic for our CI.\r\n\r\nIf we are happy with it, the first production run should probably be done on a Friday night so that CI has some time to deal with the coming PRs.",
