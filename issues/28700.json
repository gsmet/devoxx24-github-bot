  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nIt would be terribly useful to have a widget on DevServices/ dev ui that one could use to see emails that have been sent by the service.\r\n\r\nI was thinking something inspired by the `MockMailbox` utility used for testing; just simple read-only (from dev ui) list of addresses sent to, and the emails that were sent.\r\n\r\nThis would be way easier than making devs setup their dev instance with an actual email server.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\nImplementation similar to other dev service widgets.\r\n\r\nMaybe a flag, similar to `quarkus.mailer.mock` that would help control this? Or perhaps if that is on, enable this widget?",
