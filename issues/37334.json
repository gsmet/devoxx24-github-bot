  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nWe were thinking of leveraging `@RequestScoped` inside a filter, to have capability of programatic registration of sensitive data, beyond pattern-based example described in #33392 \r\n\r\nHowever when using async=true, we noticed the filters were not executing on the AsyncHandler but on the nested handler.\r\ncf https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/6048280a15e2bc25ed611a35c34b5217f5d83b08/core/runtime/src/main/java/io/quarkus/runtime/logging/LoggingSetupRecorder.java#L580-L582\r\n `@RequestScoped` injection doesn't work in that case. Typically one would use MDC to pass \"request scope\" data to the handler, but in this case it might not be a good idea to put sensitive values in MDC which is a public API.\r\n\r\nWould it make sense to have filters execute synchronously on the AsyncHandler when in async mode ?\r\n\r\n- Pros: filtered logs don't have to be queued.\r\n- Cons: the filtering time blocks the request.\r\n\r\nOur main use case is with https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-logging-splunk, but I think the behavior has to be consitent with the core handlers.\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\n_No response_",
