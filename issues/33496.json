  "body": "While moving our Strimzi HTTP bridge from Quarkus 2.x to Quarkus 3.x I noticed the following log on application startup ...\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n2023-05-19 15:00:01,604 WARN  [io.qua.con.build] (main) The 'quarkus.quartz.start-mode' config property is deprecated and should not be used anymore\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight now we are using the `quarkus.quartz.start-mode=forced` property because we don't have scheduled methods but we need to schedule a job programmatically.\r\nFollowing the above message I tried to remove that property, because I thought it was not needed anymore but now I get the usual exception:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n2023-05-19 15:01:50,789 ERROR [io.qua.run.Application] (Quarkus Main Thread) Failed to start application (with profile [dev]): java.lang.IllegalStateException: Quartz scheduler is either explicitly disabled through quarkus.scheduler.enabled=false or no @Scheduled methods were found. If you only need to schedule a job programmatically you can force the start of the scheduler by setting 'quarkus.scheduler.start-mode=forced'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt says me to set that property ... while it's deprecated??\r\nAt the same time I see the doc still mention it [here](https://quarkus.io/guides/scheduler-reference#programmatic_scheduling).\r\n\r\n```\r\nBy default, the scheduler is not started unless a @Scheduled business method is found. You may need to force the start of the scheduler for \"pure\" programmatic scheduling via quarkus.scheduler.start-mode=forced.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I am confused about how to interpreting the WARN.",
