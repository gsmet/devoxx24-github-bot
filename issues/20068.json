  "body": "### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is how I am using it but wanted to check before creating a ticket.\r\n\r\nI have a REST endpoint which injects a service and the service calls a RESTclient.  That RESTclient returns a Multi<?> but i get a \"BlockedMethodNotAllowed\" exception.\r\n\r\nIt would look like this: Resource --> Service --> REST Client.\r\n\r\nCurrently:\r\n- I use the RESTClients with Uni<?> now and those work fine (if i convert the multi to an uni<collection> it works fine).\r\n- I use Multi<?> in services, not REST clients, and those work fine.\r\n- I can directly hit the service being called by the REST client, which returns a Multi<?>, and that works fine.\r\n- I only seem to have this error trying to pass-through to the REST client and it returns a Multi<?>\r\n\r\nThis is the error I get:\r\n```\r\nSep 10, 2021 1:14:26 PM io.quarkus.vertx.http.runtime.QuarkusErrorHandler handle\r\nERROR: HTTP Request to /ping/ failed, error id: 6269d36a-bbe6-4e95-9c15-d759f2fb5c88-1\r\norg.jboss.resteasy.reactive.common.core.BlockingNotAllowedException\r\n        at org.jboss.resteasy.reactive.client.impl.InvocationBuilderImpl.unwrap(InvocationBuilderImpl.java:195)\r\n```\r\n\r\n[multi.zip](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/files/7145390/multi.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nMulti results are passed up to the REST endpoint where the call originates.  Uni<?> works fine and resource not using the REST client can return Multi<?> fine as well.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nA \"BlockingNotAllowedException\" is thrown with a direct pass-through to the REST client.\r\n\r\n### How to Reproduce?\r\n\r\nRun reproducer test.\r\n\r\n### Quarkus version or git rev\r\n\r\n2.1.4.Final\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nAs a side question somewhat related to this.  Coming from the Project Reactor world, everything was delineated by Mono or Flux.  Collections were generally returned as Flux.  Comparing to the Mutiny documentation it looks like Uni<Collection<?>> is used more frequently.\r\n\r\nIs it wrong to use Multi<?> when returning a collection (I usually don't know what the size is) or should I try to use Uni< Collection<?> > where I know there is a finite size (maybe huge)?
