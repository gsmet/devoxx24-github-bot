  "body": "### Description\n\nhttps://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/36108 was an attempt to detect regressions in native builds when certain metrics are outside a given range. Unfortunately this doesn't seem to work well in practice. The main reason seems to be that multiple PRs gradually increase the metrics without hitting the threshold. Then a new PR that happens to increase the metrics a bit more triggers a failure. Although this PR might not be responsible for the total increase (that resulted in hitting the threshold) it is the one being blocked.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nA thought we had within the mandrel team (cc @Karm @jerboaa) and we are working towards it is the following.\r\n\r\nWe would like to start collecting data from Quarkus CI runs (initially from runs on `main` and lately probably from PRs as well). This will allow us to observe the change over time (as show in https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/39674#issuecomment-2026079349) instead of just when we hit a threshold.\r\n\r\nNext we would ideally like to feed these data to a tool with anomaly detection (possibly https://horreum.hyperfoil.io/) in order to get automated alerts when something seems wrong. That could be:\r\n\r\n1. Create a generic GH issue when we have crossed a threshold from the last known \"good state\"\r\n2. Create a PR specific issue or comment in an open PR if it appears to be causing a sudden increase in the metrics we are interested in.\r\n\r\nRelated PRs:\r\n1. https://github.com/Karm/collector/pull/23\r\n2. https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/39784\r\n\r\n\r\n",
