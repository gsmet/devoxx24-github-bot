  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nWarn users if they mix RESTEasy Classic and Reactive.\r\n\r\nWe had issue with application that was RESTEasy Reactive base but we used `resteasy-multipart-provider` for easy work with multipart form data. Starting with Quarkus 3.0 there is MultipartFormDataInput so I could migrate the app to use it.\r\n\r\nIn our case it wasn't obvious what the trouble was because native image build failed with error message about ResourceCleaner, the issue was reported on product side in https://issues.redhat.com/browse/QUARKUS-3308\r\n\r\nIs Quarkus able to detect that an application mixes RESTEasy Classic and Reactive? If so, there could be a warning about that - during the build and maybe also during the boot.\r\n\r\n",
