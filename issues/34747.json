Please use\r\n     *             {@link ConfigUtils#getProfiles()} instead, which returns a List of profiles.\r\n     */\r\n   \r\n   ConfigUtils#getProfiles() doesn't really seem to help here - AFAIK it returns a list of all possible profiles, and then for each profile, we need to ask if it is currently active. Why not directly returning a list of active profiles? \n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n_No response_",
