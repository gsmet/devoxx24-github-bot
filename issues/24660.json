  "body": "### Description\n\nHi,\r\n\r\nI posted a [question on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71680113/how-can-i-reuse-containers-during-integration-tests-with-quarkus?noredirect=1#comment126694045_71680113), @geoand told me it was not possible and to ask for the feature so here I am.\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to take advantage of the reuse feature of testcontainers through classes implementing QuarkusTestResourceLifecycleManager. Currently containers are shutdown in between test classes and the possibility to prevent that would be great as some containers take several seconds to launch and after a few tests the startup time for containers starts to have a real impact on build time.\r\n\r\nThanks for the great work on the Quarkus project by the way !\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n_No response_",
