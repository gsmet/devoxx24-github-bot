  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI am trying to use the JUnit ParameterResolver to deduplicate code in our unit tests. We have common code, that requires to create some entities before a test class and delete the entities after the tests are finished.\r\n\r\nSadly I have stumbled over the fact, that quarkus does not seem to provide support towards the ParamterResolver.\r\n\r\nI have created a sample project on GitHub, including a ReadMe File to explain the issues I discovered.\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/pfaul/quarkus-test-extension](https://github.com/pfaul/quarkus-test-extension)\r\n\r\n_EDIT: I have added a branch (cdi_bean) to the project, where I attempt to use an application scoped bean to store the value. Sadly this attempt also does not work. The error states `Unable to locate CDIProvider` during the resolveParameter exection._\r\n\r\nI really appreciate any help towards solving this setup. Maybe I am just missing some feature, that is already available.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\n_No response_",
