  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nI've mentioned extensions migrating to `@ConfigMapping` along its own axis. Some of them try to solve a bug like Hibernate, but there are other objections like performance, efficiency and possibly new features (config classes are maintained if there is a major bug found, but not developed). Cons is that some config classes can be injected by integrating extensions or users, therefore they can be considered API - https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/35246. However I don't believe that is a case of OIDC, how many extensions and users outside of Quarkus core extensions really needs to inject configuration classes as CDI beans, or use them in a build step?\r\n\r\nI'd like to migrate OIDC config because I think impact will be absolutely minor. I don't know why should users inject OIDC config in general. Waiting probably solves nothing and migration can have positive performance impact (though migrating OIDC alone will hardly be measurable, it is one piece of the puzzle...).\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\n_No response_",
