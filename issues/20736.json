  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nThe JWT guide,  https://quarkus.io/guides/security-jwt, like its OIDC friends, has become badly structured (Quickstart and the ref info is intermixed) but it is worse than that with the JWT guide as the section on generating JWT tokens is totally unrelated - it can be used alongside MP JWT servers but it is meant not to be tied in to MP JWT, so the section about generating JWT tokens has to be moved into its own guide to make it more visible.\r\nI'd still like to avoid splitting the actual quickstart and ref parts along the way - in this case alone it would produce 4 docs instead of 1 (both JWT server and JWT build may have the quickstarts and the ref parts, so alongside with OIDC we'd have 4 here + 2 per OIDC service and 2 per OIDC web-app - 8 in total instead of 3 and the sec guides will start exploding). This is certainly something that needs to be seriously looked at, but as I suggested in the OIDC doc issue, I'd like to try to do it stages, first improve the structure and then move on to a split - I think introducing a hierarchical view may simplify it. \r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\n_No response_",
