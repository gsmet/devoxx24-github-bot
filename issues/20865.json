I expected that after a restart the trigger will be set to the new value. I found something very similar in spring quartz where there was a property called spring.quartz.overwrite-existing-jobs. Is there a similar feature in quarkus or is it a bug? Not sure about this. I could create a workaround and do the scheduling programatically but I was wondering if there was a simple solution to this issue. ",
