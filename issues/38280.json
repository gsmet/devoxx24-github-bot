  "body": "### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nQute asHtmlAttributes is including `it` as  \"key\"=\"key\" and also as `\"it\"`. \r\n\r\nThe `it` is easy to filter out using `skip(\"it\")` but I think it should always be ignored from the args list, it is an artificial arg (I don't see any use case where you would want the `it` in the args).\r\n\r\nThen it's about the key only args:\r\n1. sometime you want to skip them all because you only want to keep the `key=value` args => `skipKeyOnlyArgs()`\r\n2. sometime you want to only skip the first one because it's consumed as `it` => `skipIt` and you want to print the other one (for example `readonly=\"readonly\"`).\r\n\r\nI don't see yet any usecase for 1 but since it's dynamic, this is the only way to do it (so better have something).\r\nWith those two methods you are free to do almost anything because key value args are easier to skip (non dynamic).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
