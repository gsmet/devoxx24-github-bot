  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nPreviously change https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/25117 introduced the option to set both `quarkus.http.proxy.allow-forwarded` and `quarkus.http.proxy.allow-x-forwarded` at the same time. It is rightly highlighted in the docs that this combination is not recommended and there can be security implications if used ([doc link](https://quarkus.io/guides/http-reference#reverse-proxy)). \r\n\r\nWhen both are enabled, Quarkus currently uses `Forwarded` over `X-Forwarded-*` if both headers are present. However many popular proxies like NGINX and Envoy do not seem to support `Forwarded` - they do support `X-Forwarded-*`. As a result, application that enabled both will be subject to header forging (untrusted client setting `Forwarded`), unless user of the application realizes this and explicitly re-configures the proxy to overwrite `Forwarded`.  If the order Quarkus parses the headers would be the other way around (`X-Forwarded-*` over `Forwarded`) this would not be the case. Even if user missed reconfiguring the proxy and uses the defaults, they would be safe(r).\r\n\r\nAnother reasoning for the idea: often the backwards compatibility design principles say that old functionality should take precedence over new functionality.\r\n\r\nIf you consider this idea of swapping the priority something you'd take into Quarkus, I can contribute it.\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\n_No response_",
