  "body": "I'm trying to write `@QuarkusMainTest` tests and the output is hard to test because I end up with:\r\n```\r\n2022-03-13 12:27:52,367 INFO  [org.jbo.threads] (main) JBoss Threads version 3.4.2.Final\r\n```\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nI saw it for other tests too but it's especially annoying when dealing with command mode tests as you can't test the output properly.\r\n\r\n@famod I believe this is due to the change you made to initialize the loggers earlier in the tests. @geoand worked around it by adding a specific test in the mojo and Gradle logger but it doesn't work for all cases and I think we need a more general fix.",
