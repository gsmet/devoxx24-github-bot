I have bandwidth to implement it and my idea would be to add it in as a  quarkiverse project.I have the bandwidth to implement it, and my idea would be to add it in as a  quarkiverse project.It\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nFor implementing this DevService I would like to find an example of a DevService that waits until other DevServices are up and running. Also, an example of a DevService getting the configuration properties of other DevServices. I need this as Debezium needs to start when the DB devservice and the Kafka devservice is up and running.",
