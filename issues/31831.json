  "body": "It would be nice to have Quarkiverse CXF in the Platform. This would give it some more visibility and would solve the problem that Quarkus tooling is currently generating projects without quarkus-cxf-bom.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not feel like I have enough time to do the upgrades in the Platform manually. I wonder whether some CI solution would be possible on either Platform or participant side that would create the Platform PR automatically, including the generated BOMs?\r\n",
