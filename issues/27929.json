  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nI'm working on the camel-quarkus (issue https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/issues/4076). I encountered a problem.\r\nCamel Quartz component is trying to autowire a quartz scheduler (recent change - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-18143). \r\n**Before** Camel change - the scheduler was created in the component. \r\n**After** the change -  Quarkus's Quartz scheduler is created every time, even if it is not required by any code. Which causes IllegalStateException `Quartz scheduler is either explicitly disabled through quarkus.scheduler.enabled=false or no @Scheduled methods were found. If you only need to schedule a job programmatically you can force the start of the scheduler by setting 'quarkus.quartz.start-mode=forced'.` ([code](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/main/extensions/quartz/runtime/src/main/java/io/quarkus/quartz/runtime/QuartzScheduler.java#L340)).\r\n\r\nThe exception is correct in the sense that no `@Scheduled` method is created. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the scheduler was not created in case that there is no demand for it (like no `@Scheduled` method).\r\nIt doesn't make sense to create a scheduler if it is not asked for, and more importantly if a creation of such bean fails, because there is no `@Scheduled` method. \r\n(idea is to set 'quarkus.quartz.start-mode=forced' if there is no scheduled bean)\r\n\r\nDo you think that the proposed solution breaks any known use-case?",
