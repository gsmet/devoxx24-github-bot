  "body": "When injecting or observing a `Router` bean from `vertx-http`, if you attempt to set up a `POST` route (or any route that needs to read the request body), when trying to read the request body in the route handler, the application will become stuck and no body is ever received. I think it might be related to https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/5959 but I'm not sure how to solve this problem without `BuildItem`s. \r\n\r\nSemi-related: how do I set up a route that isn't intercepted by other Quarkus routes using the same `Router` instance, or is it possible?\r\n\r\nCan provide a reproducer if needed.",
