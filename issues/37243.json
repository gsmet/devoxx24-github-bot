  "body": "### Description\n\nWhen connecting to a keycloak instance that has TLS encryption enabled, for example when running in Openshift with a certificate provided by the Service CA, the certificate cannot be provided to the extension and the only option is to set it system-wide which requires elevated privileges to do.\r\n\r\nAfter #37206 is possible to disable TLS verification altogether, but that may not be desired for other extensions. \r\n\r\nIn addition to that mutual TLS is not possible at all because we cannot set client certificate.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nShould be something similar to what has been done for oidc client extension in #18012 .",
