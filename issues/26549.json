  "body": "### Description\n\nIt would be nice if Quarkus had some kind of callback mechanism which would allow registering a listener which would be notified when an authorization check either failed or succeeded. An application could use this to implement a custom security logging mechanism.\r\n\r\nCurrently, this is not so simple, because depending on whether the authorization rules are declared using annotations (`@RolesAllowed` et al.) or config properties (`quarkus.http.auth.*`) and depending on whether the outcome of the check was \"allow\" or \"deny\", different hooks need to be used, which could possibly also conflict with other uses of those hooks.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nOne idea would be to fire CDI events with the details.",
