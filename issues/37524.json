  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nWe are reaching out to seek your assistance with a specific challenge we are facing in our Quarkus application.\r\n\r\n**Overview:**\r\nWe have a cron job triggering two services: one reactive service managing business logic using one of the two datasources, and the other handling persistence in our second datasource.\r\nOur initial aim was to create a reactive application, but we discovered that the library we are using does not fully support reactive operations. As a result, we shifted to \"quarkus-hibernate-orm-panache\" since Hibernate ORM better aligns with our needs.\r\n\r\n**The Challenge:**\r\nThe issue arises when a reactive cron job triggers our services, calling a method annotated with \"@Transactional.\" Within this method, we perform a blocking Hibernate \"persist\" operation.\r\nThis leads to the exception: \"io.quarkus.runtime.BlockingOperationNotAllowedException: Cannot start a JTA transaction from the IO thread.\"\r\n\r\n**Reproducer:**\r\nTo aid in understanding and resolving the matter, we have provided a reproducer with the same configuration, replicating the exception.\r\n\r\n**Producer Link:**\r\nhttps://github.com/OAboutayeb/Quarkus-Producer\r\n\r\n**Additional Context:**\r\nInitially, our goal was straightforward: a reactive cron job calling services that use two datasources with Hibernate ORM. We perform persistence only with one datasource. The current issue involves attempting to persist a detached entity. While we have successfully made the cron job work by manually attaching the entity with a \"merge,\" we aim to automatically attach the entity, using a simple \".persist()\" approach.\r\n\r\n**Request for Assistance:**\r\nWe sincerely appreciate your insights and guidance in navigating this challenge. If you require additional information or have specific requests, please do not hesitate to let us know.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\nJava 17\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n_No response_\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\nmaven\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",
