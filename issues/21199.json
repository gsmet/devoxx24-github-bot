  "body": "Based on reading the blog post [RESTEasy Reactive - To block or not to block](https://quarkus.io/blog/resteasy-reactive-smart-dispatch/)\r\n\r\nHow to setup hibernate reactive + JPA for accessing EntityManager +  PanacheRepository (classic) or PanacheRepository (reactive) based on signatures ?\r\n\r\nOne understands that defaults for reactive and blocking has changed, ok.. nice. But also for the same post we can infer that things like `@Transacional` are infered to be blocking, and that the transactional manager should work over JPA (since its blocking.) \r\n\r\nMeaning, in the end that we can conbine both worlds in the same application. I've tried to setup such project without success where hibernate conflicts between hibernate reactive and JPA.\r\n\r\nIn my understanding things should work like (using panache for example..)\r\n- Add panache hibernate reactive\r\n- Add panache hibernate JPA\r\n- Setup two datasources (r2dbc and jdbc)\r\n- When use `@Transacional` the classic path happens (use `EntityManager` , ThreadLocals, transaction support) and is possible to use normal `PanacheEntity` with `PanacheRepository` classic\r\n- When returning Unis and Multis things hapen with reactive in I/O Threads.. using `PanacheRepository` from reactive package\r\n\r\nSo, is this possible or did i get it wrong? \r\n\r\nWhats is the POM for non-conflict  ?",
