  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nSay I have a system that looks like this:\r\n\r\n![superhero](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/363447/132736111-4da4aa66-8c1a-44d7-b3d8-8a6826eae844.png)\r\n\r\nMaybe the **Hero** & **Villain** services have a source repo somewhere or a container image published somewhere and I now want to work on the **Fight** service. It would be _really_ slick if somehow I could configure Quarkus Dev Services to run those dependent services as part of running my service.\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\nNot really implementation ideas, but things to think about.\r\n\r\n- Both the **Hero** & **Villain** services also have their own dependencies (each their own PostgreSQL DB), so those would have to be started too\r\n- Both the **Hero** & **Villain** services may want to run on the same http port (`8080`), so they'd have to be mapped & configured somehow. Each service URL would have to have a matching property or something that the developer working on the **Fight** service would use for its URL (i.e. as described in the [rest client guide](https://quarkus.io/guides/rest-client))\r\n    - Maybe some kind of configuration like this (I'm just spitballing here - I'm not sure how to express the dependency between the **Hero** service and its DB, since an env var would need to be set on that service to bind it to its db)\r\n       ```yaml\r\n       quarkus:\r\n         devservices:\r\n           dependencies:\r\n             - image-name: quay.io/<repo>/hero-image:latest\r\n               port-bindings:\r\n                 - 8081:8080 # Binds port 8080 in the container to port 8081 on the host\r\n               properties:\r\n                 org.acme.rest.client.HeroService/mp-rest/url=http://localhost:8081/path\r\n             - image-name: quay.io/<repo>/villain-image:latest\r\n               port-bindings:\r\n                 - 8082: 8080  # Binds port 8080 in the container to port 8082 on the host\r\n               properties:\r\n                 org.acme.rest.client.VillainService/mp-rest/url=http://localhost:8082/path\r\n       ```\r\n\r\nThis does start to get into some really tall weeds though. Working on the **Fight** app, I'd have to know about all of its downstream dependencies, and all of their dependencies (recursively) and have to express them.\r\n\r\nMaybe if the downstream dependencies contained a `docker-compose` or something to \"isolate\" all of its dependencies? Again, just spitballing/thinking out loud.",
