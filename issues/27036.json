  "body": "### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading from **2.9.2.Final**, requests to the GraphQL API for secured resources (queries / mutations) may spuriously fail with an \"unauthorized\" error-code.\r\n\r\nI have created a [simple Quarkus GraphQL project](https://github.com/nvrs/quarkus-graphql-auth-issue) that uses the the https://quarkus.io/guides/microprofile-graphql as a base to exhibit / reproduce the issue. Specifically, the quarkus GraphQL example has been modified by adding an extra method to the API (`allFilmsSecured`) that's secured using the standard `@Authenticated` annotation, and leveraged the `quarkus-elytron-security-properties-file` extension to configure a set of valid user credentials.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWhen querying the secured endpoint with the correct credentials (HTTP Basic Auth) concurrenctly with / without other unsecured endpoints, one should not receive `unauthorized` error-code responses.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nGiven enough concurrent requests (tests are configured to 50 but failures occur with fewer too), some will fail with `unauthorized` error-code. What's also suprising is that the unexpected behaviour is not exactly the same for all versions > 2.9.2.Final. Specifically, for versions up to **2.10.3.Final** the bug seems to occur only when there are concurrent requests with different security credentials and / or a combination of resources with different security restrictions. However on **2.10.4.Final** and **2.11.1.Final** failures are observed even when loading the service with concurrent requests for the same resource with the exact same credentials.\r\n\r\n### How to Reproduce?\r\n\r\nExecuting the Junit tests in [ConcurrentAuthTest](https://github.com/nvrs/quarkus-graphql-auth-issue/blob/main/src/test/java/org/acme/microprofile/graphql/ConcurrentAuthTest.java) reproduces the issue on two machines that I have tried it out (8 cores / 16 threads - Ryzen 58000x, and 4 cores / 8 threads intel i7 kaby lake). On the test class there are two tests, one that attempts concurrent requests on both secured and unsecured resources (that fails on all versions > **2.9.2.Final**), and another that only performs concurrent requests on the secured resource that fails only on **2.10.4.Final** and **2.11.1.Final**.\r\n\r\nA [JMeter Test Plan](https://github.com/nvrs/quarkus-graphql-auth-issue/blob/main/graphql-auth-test.jmx) is also included that reproduces the issue very reliably (JSON Assertions fail when receiving `unauthorized` error codes).\r\n\r\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\r\n\r\nLinux fedora-desktop 5.18.13-200.fc36.x86_64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri Jul 22 14:03:36 UTC 2022 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n\r\n### Output of `java -version`\r\n\r\nopenjdk version \"17.0.2\" 2022-01-18 OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-17.0.2+8 (build 17.0.2+8) OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-17.0.2+8 (build 17.0.2+8, mixed mode, sharing)\r\n\r\n### GraalVM version (if different from Java)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Quarkus version or git rev\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\r\n\r\nApache Maven 3.8.4\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_",
