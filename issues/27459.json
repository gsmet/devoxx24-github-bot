  "body": "### Description\n\nWe would like all of our JAX-RS services that use a PanacheMongoRepository<> datasource to use @Transactional(Transactional.TxType.REQUIRED).\r\n\r\nThis works fine if the app is deployed in a clustered Mongo DB environment, however when deployed in a single Mongo instance environment it causes runtime errors saying it can't handle/create transactions.\r\n\r\nSo our only workaround was to remove all usages of @Transactional(Transactional.TxType.REQUIRED) which then does work in both environments.\r\n\r\nWe would like to see Quarkus improved so that we can use @Transactional where it can be supported and just warn in single Mongo instance environments where it can't be supported.  Even better would be to support @Transactional in single Mongo instances as well.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\n_No response_",
