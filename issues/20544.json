  "body": "**Akka / Actor Model Support -- Maybe an Akka Extension**\r\n\r\nHi, I would like a way to use Akka Actors with Quarkus because the Reactive features currently present are nice but I really need an actor model solution and it is missing from Quarkus.\r\n\r\nI saw from other Github issues that Quarkus has an extension / support for Scala but it seems like you have to have a special setup for that. I tried doing that special setup with the help of the quickstart generator and it seems that writing Scala works to some extent but when I start using Akka, I was still having great difficulties. \r\n\r\nI also tried the base gradle/java quarkus starter (which I would like to use because I am using Java the whole way through except Akka uses Scala inside its core) -- I tried to importing Akka just like I do with a normal Java/Gradle project but I get the following error when I try to do that:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: scala/$less$colon$less\r\n```\r\n\r\nI feel like it shouldn't be too hard to use Akka with Quarkus and it very much fits in the Reactive paradigm which Quarkus aims to support, but so far my experience trying to get this to work has been fairly painful for compilation reasons. \r\n",
