  "body": "### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nI'm doing a PoC for a native runtime of Keycloak, and have observed much worse performance with native mode compared to JVM mode than I would have expected.\r\n\r\nI've stripped Keycloak down to the bear bones for a OIDC use-case for this purpose as I was also looking for what a very small distribution of Keycloak would look like, not just the benefits of native vs jvm. The PoC is available [here](https://github.com/stianst/keycloak/tree/minicloak).\r\n\r\nFor those familiar with Keycloak the key differences here are:\r\n\r\n* Removed features such as SAML, LDAP, embedded Infinispan caches\r\n* Only support external PostgreSQL database\r\n\r\nStartup time and memory usage of native mode is impressive, while throughout and latency is a lot worse than I was hoping for. I appreciate there is a performance impact of native vs JVM, but this is a lot higher than I was expecting.\r\n\r\nFrom a 10 min run on my laptop with a local PostgreSQL database I get the following results with 10 concurrent users sending requests:\r\n\r\nNative (min=15, 95th=29, max=64):\r\n![image](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/assets/2271511/3602f09d-e6d2-4ef4-bc71-db196c73e8f5)\r\n\r\nJVM (min=8, 95th=20, max=282):\r\n![image](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/assets/2271511/4066d9ef-0b5c-46ff-890f-9e20bdd4c8ca)\r\n\r\nCouple things to observe here:\r\n\r\n* Latency is almost 2x on native vs JVM\r\n* Latency is very stable with JVM, with only some occasional spikes (probably GC), while on native there's constantly a big difference between the request times\r\n\r\nI opened this as a bug, but perhaps it could be converted to a discussion, as I'm not sure it's something on my end, or if this is an issue in Quarkus. I've also done no tuning of native, pretty much just using whatever Quarkus comes with by default.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nLatency/throughput is stable in native mode, and performance is closer to JVM mode.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nBig difference between latency in native and JVM modes, and native mode giving very different response times for parallel requests.\r\n\r\n### How to Reproduce?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\r\n\r\nLinux fedora 6.4.10-200.fc38.x86_64\r\n\r\n### Output of `java -version`\r\n\r\nopenjdk version \"17.0.8\" 2023-07-18\r\n\r\n### GraalVM version (if different from Java)\r\n\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Mandrel-23.0.0.0-Final\r\n\r\n### Quarkus version or git rev\r\n\r\n3.2.4.Final\r\n\r\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\r\n\r\nApache Maven 3.9.2\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_",
