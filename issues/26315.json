  "body": "###\r\nThere should be an easy way to start and keep the `@QuarkusIntegrationTest` environment running for a rapid test development and verification cicle.\r\n\r\n### The current way\r\nWenn working with `@QuarkusIntegrationTest`, the current procedure for developing new tests looks like this:\r\n\r\n1. Write a test for my api\r\n2. Start `@QuarkusIntegrationTest` with everything that comes with it (Dev services, TestResources, container under test, etc) and wait to verify the just-written test (wait 5 minutes)\r\n3. Watch the whole test setup gets torn down again.\r\n4. Refactor test or write next one, anyway repeat from step 1.\r\n\r\nEach cicle (without the writing of the test!), depending on the project, takes 5 minutes. This is very discouraging and will lead to sloppy tests, if at all, and is simply a waste of time.\r\n\r\nTo kinda achiev this with the tools today I could:\r\n\r\n1. Try to replicate the whole setup in a separate docker compose, which is prone to errors, as it is not the same environment as in a regular `@QuarkusIntegrationTest` run and needs to be in sync with the test setup all the time.\r\n2. Set a debug breakpoint and start my test in a different process.\r\n\r\nBoth seems not to be a good way.\r\n\r\n### The way it could be\r\n\r\n1. Start `@QuarkusIntegrationTest` in e.g. _dev-mode_ (maybe diectly as property of the annotation), which will cause the whole test environment to start up and keep running. \r\n3. Then I can develop my test and execute them independently as unit test in my ide for verification against my running environment.\r\n\r\nThis way I can write and verify, without having to reup the whole environment every time. Obviously, executing a test can change the state of the deployed artefacts, but this is acceptable fact. As each test class can be annotated with different `@QuarkusTestResource`,  there might be an option, or maybe even a must, to do this within a scope of a single test class.",
