  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nIn 2.11.3 the REST-server spans were named after the rest-method called (e.g. /api/bla/...) while since 2.12.1 (at least) they are just \"HTTP GET\".\r\nThis is problematic from a user / admin point of view, as in Jaeger e.g. the search is for \"operation is populated by span name\r\nAlso both in Jaeger and Tempo UI, the span name is what is shown in the list of traces. Meaning that now I have tons of \"HTTP GET\" operations and can't easily see and select for which endpoint \r\nApparently there is a `http.target` tag that can be used for filtering, but that is not auto-populated in the Jaeger UI.\r\n\r\n#opentelemetry\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nSpan names should be the name of the HTTP endpoint.\r\nIf that can't be determined e.g. in the reactive case, it should at least be possible to use the well established behaviour for non-reactive endpoints. perhaps enabled via a flag.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nSpan names are 'HTTP GET' or 'HTTP POST', which is much too generic\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n1. Deploy a quarkus app with 2.11 with a rest-endpoint and opentelemetry enabled. Hit the endpoint and look at the created span\r\n2. Bump Quarkus to 2.11 and hit the endpoint again -> behaviour has changed.\r\n\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n_No response_\n\n### GraalVM version (if different from Java)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n_No response_\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",
