  "body": "### Description\n\nSee https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/35065 for the original discussion\r\n\r\nQuarkus extensions can currently declare an endpoint on the management interface by depending on `quarkus-vertx-http-deployment` and [using a build item specific to vertx-http](https://quarkus.io/guides/management-interface-reference#management-endpoint-extension).\r\n\r\nHowever, some extensions don't have any other reason to depend on vertx-http; they could theoretically be used in a CLI application that has no vertx at all.\r\n\r\nFor these extensions, adding the dependency to vertx-http is problematic, because there is no way to make the dependency optional:\r\n\r\n* They need a dependency to the deployment artifact, and that dependency [cannot be made optional](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/35065#issuecomment-1733167464)\r\n* They also need a dependency to the runtime artifact, and if the dependency to the deployment artifact is non-optional, then the runtime dependency [cannot be optional](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/35065#issuecomment-1733249579) (which makes sense: the deployment's build steps could generate bytecode that depends on the runtime)\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nOne solution to get out of this sorry state of affairs would be to introduce a `quarkus-vertx-http-deployment-spi` artifact, which would:\r\n\r\n* depend transitively on `quarkus-vertx-http` (runtime)\r\n* expose all relevant build items designed to be produced/consumed by other extensions: `NonApplicationRootPathBuildItem`, `RouteBuildItem`, ...\r\n* NOT contain any build steps, so its presence in the classpath would not, by itself, affect the build.\r\n\r\nThen it would be possible for another extension to depend on `quarkus-vertx-http-deployment-spi` in its deployment artifact, and to depend optionally (`<optional>true</optional>`) on `quarkus-vertx-http` (runtime) in its runtime artifact:\r\n\r\n* If an application contains this other extension without  `quarkus-vertx-http`, the contribution to the management interface would get ignored: the relevant build items would not get consumed.\r\n* If an application contains this other extension **and**  `quarkus-vertx-http`, the contribution to the management interface would be taken into account: `quarkus-vertx-http-deployment` would be in the build classpath, along with its build steps that consume the relevant build items.",
