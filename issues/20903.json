  "body": "### Description\n\nWhen `Keycloak Dev Services` are enabled its DevUI can acquire the tokens using the `code` flow but also the `password` and `client credentials` grants - using the `password` grant for testing only might be preferred by some users (working with the code flow should be preferred but it may require the users having to configure Keycloak etc with the DevUI callback). I think Stephane may have suggested that it can be simpler just to enter a user name and password in DevUI...\r\n\r\nWhen we run `quarkus:dev` with `quarkus.auth.server-url` already configured, `Keycloak Dev Services` is disabled, and only `OIDC Dev UI` is provided - be it `Keycloak` or `Auth0` etc - however in this case even for Keycloak it is not possible to use the `password` or `client_cred` grants while supporting them it may be essential for other providers like Auth0 which does offer a standard logout endpoint, thus using a code flow with Auth0 effectively restricts testing to a single user only. \r\n\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nThe problem is that the grant type is configured in `quarkus.keycloak.devservices.grant.type` - this is not really correct, not only because using the same config to set up Auth0 is not good but also because the grant type does not affect the actual devservices container in any way - it is purely a Dev UI related configuration - the grant type affects how Dev UI will present the screen offering to acquire the tokens and test the service. `quarkus.keycloak.devservices.grant.type` (as well as a web client timeout used by the web client supporting DevUI handlers) are not used when checking if KC DevServices container has to be restarted.\r\n\r\nThis property needs to be moved to `quarkus.oidc.devui` namespace, which will be cleaner, and also having `quarkus.oidc.devui.grant.type` will be much better for supporting all the providers",
