  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nIn the past we have used GraalVM flags that result in _worse_ build times for native executables in order to reduce the system resources used at build time, e.g. https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/21018.\r\n\r\nI [recently noticed](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-images/issues/260#issuecomment-1944060767) that GraalVM is doing something similar when it comes to configuring the JVM that runs the native image builder, which leads to slower build times when using GraalVM for JDK 21 and GraalVM for JDK 17 in comparison to using the older GraalVM 22.3 in exchange to using less memory at build time.\r\n\r\nAlthough this makes sense in some environments it's a waste of time and resources (as they just stay idle) in others, e.g. in GH runners were we run a single build per runner so we are OK with it using as much memory as possible.\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\nI propose the introduction of a new `quarkus.native.*` property that will control whether we want the native image build to be frugal when it comes to resource usage, or greedy. Instead of a binary switch this could potentially have states, e.g. `frugal`, `balanced`, `greedy`. The value of the property would essentially control the default flags we are passing to GraalVM.\r\n",
