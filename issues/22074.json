  "body": "### Description\n\nLifecyfle managers can need to spin up different services in different ways for different test profiles.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the only way for the `QuarkusTestResourceLifecycleManager` to know how setup resources from one test to another are through `initArgs`. This works, but has a couple flaws:\r\n\r\n - requires arg to be set for every test class of different profiles\r\n - makes for very long-winded annotations, even for single flags\r\n\r\nIf `QuarkusTestResourceLifecycleManager` had a way to access at bare minimum what profile is currently running, or even had access to preliminary configs, it would eliminate the need for all the extra annotations.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nJust throwing ideas out, but concerning the `start()` method;\r\n\r\nInstead of returning values to override config, what if the `start()` method takes as a parameter the current configMap: `start(Map<String, String> configMap)`. This would allow for both overrides to that map and for the manager to glean information about what profile might be running and what needs started up.\r\n\r\nOr just add a method or member to `QuarkusTestResourceLifecycleManager` that takes the current config/ running test profile that makes it available to implementations.",
