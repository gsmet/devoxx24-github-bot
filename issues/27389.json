  "body": "We are using Quarkus with FORM based authentication and JDBC backend with the JSF extension so we can use MyFaces/Primefaces.\r\n\r\nThis is a great link to get Primefaces working on Quarkus!\r\nhttps://github.com/melloware/quarkus-faces\r\n\r\nEverything works fine and I can log in and see the cookie Quarkus-credential be created and all is well with the SecurityIdentity, etc.\r\n\r\nQuestion is, how do I let the user logout? We need to have the ability to manually log out users from our website. \r\n\r\nI tried the following code which I found on the web, but I'm suspecting this isn't working because there is no HTTPSession?\r\n\r\nAccording to: https://quarkus.io/guides/security-built-in-authentication#form-auth only a cookie is created?\r\n\r\nSo, how do I let the user manually log out via a link on the webpage? Am I going to have to write some client-side javascript to manually delete the cookies? I don't want to solely rely on the cookie expirations, etc.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic void logout() {\r\n        FacesContext context = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance();\r\n        HttpServletRequest request = (HttpServletRequest) context.getExternalContext().getRequest();\r\n        try {\r\n            request.logout();\r\n            context.addMessage(null, new FacesMessage(\"Logged out.\"));\r\n        } catch (ServletException e) {\r\n            e.printStackTrace();\r\n            context.addMessage(null, new FacesMessage(\"Logout failed.\"));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```",
